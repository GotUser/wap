            <h2 class="code-line"><a id="ch_1"></a> Introduction</h2>
            <p class="has-line-data">
              Toxic people have always been a drag, but research shows they can physically harm your brain. In this, we
              show you how to keep your gray matter safe.
              <br /><br />Toxic people defy logic. Some are blissfully unaware of the negative impact that they have on
              those around them, and others seem to derive satisfaction from creating chaos and pushing other people’s
              buttons. Either way, they create unnecessary complexity, strife and, worst of all, stress.
              Studies have long shown that stress can have a lasting, negative impact on the brain.
              <br />
              <br />
              Exposure to even a few days of stress compromises the effectiveness of neurons in the hippocampus—an
              important brain area responsible for reasoning and memory. Weeks of stress cause reversible damage to
              neuronal dendrites (the small “arms” that brain cells use to communicate with each other), and months of
              stress can permanently destroy neurons. Stress is a formidable threat to your success—when stress gets out
              of control, your brain and your performance suffer.
              <br /><br />Most sources of stress at work are easy to identify. If your nonprofit is working to land a
              grant that your organization needs to function, you’re bound to feel stress and likely know how to manage
              it. It’s the unexpected sources of stress that take you by surprise and harm you the most.
              <br />
              <br />
              Recent research from the Department of Biological and Clinical Psychology at Friedrich Schiller University
              in Germany found that exposure to stimuli that cause strong negative emotions—the same kind of exposure
              you get when dealing with toxic people—caused subjects’ brains to have a massive stress response. Whether
              it’s negativity, cruelty, the victim syndrome or just plain craziness, toxic people drive your brain into
              a stressed-out state that should be avoided at all costs.
              The ability to manage your emotions and remain calm under pressure has a direct link to your performance.
              <br /><br />
              TalentSmart has conducted research with more than a million people, and we’ve found that 90 percent of top
              performers are skilled at managing their emotions in times of stress in order to remain calm and in
              control. One of their greatest gifts is the ability to neutralize toxic people. Top performers have
              well-honed coping strategies that they employ to keep toxic people at bay.
              <br /><br />While I’ve run across numerous effective strategies that successful people employ when dealing
              with toxic people, what follows are 12 of the best. To deal with toxic people effectively, you need an
              approach that enables you, across the board, to control what you can and eliminate what you can’t. The
              important thing to remember is that you are in control of far more than you realize.
            </p>


            <h2 class="code-line"><a id="ch_2"></a>
              They set limits (especially with complainers)</h2>

            <p class="has-line-data"> Complainers and negative people are bad news because they wallow in their problems
              and fail to focus on solutions. They want people to join their pity party so that they can feel better
              about themselves. People often feel pressure to listen to complainers because they don’t want to be seen
              as callous or rude, but there’s a fine line between lending a sympathetic ear and getting sucked into
              their negative emotional spiral.
              You can avoid this only by setting limits and distancing yourself when necessary.<br /><br /> Think of it
              this way: If the complainer were smoking, would you sit there all afternoon inhaling the secondhand smoke?
              You’d distance yourself, and you should do the same with complainers. A great way to set limits is to ask
              complainers how they intend to fix the problem. They will either quiet down or redirect the conversation
              in a productive direction.
            </p>


            <h2 class="code-line"><a id="ch_3"></a>
              They don’t die in the fight</h2>
            <p class="has-line-data">
              Successful people know how important it is to live to fight another day, especially when your foe is a
              toxic individual. In conflict, unchecked emotion makes you dig your heels in and fight the kind of battle
              that can leave you severely damaged. When you read and respond to your emotions, you’re able to choose
              your battles wisely and only stand your ground when the time is right.

            </p>



            <h2 class="code-line"> <a id="ch_4"></a>
              They rise above</h2>
            <p class="has-line-data"> Toxic people drive you crazy because their behavior is so irrational. Make no
              mistake about it—their behavior truly goes against reason. So why do you allow yourself to respond to them
              emotionally and get sucked into the mix?
              The more irrational and off-base someone is, the easier it should be for you to remove yourself from their
              traps.<br /><br /> Quit trying to beat them at their own game. Distance yourself from them emotionally and
              approach your interactions like they’re a science project (or you’re their shrink, if you prefer the
              analogy). You don’t need to respond to the emotional chaos—only the facts.
            </p>



            <h2 class="code-line"><a id="ch_5"></a> They stay aware of their emotions</h2>
            <p class="has-line-data"> Maintaining an emotional distance requires awareness. You can’t stop someone from
              pushing your buttons if you don’t recognize when it’s happening. Sometimes you’ll find yourself in
              situations where you’ll need to regroup and choose the best way forward. This is fine and you shouldn’t be
              afraid to buy yourself some time to do so.
              Think of it this way: If a mentally unstable person approaches you on the street and tells you he’s John
              F. Kennedy, you’re unlikely to set him straight.
              <br /><br />When you find yourself with a co-worker who is engaged in similarly derailed thinking,
              sometimes it’s best to just smile and nod. If you’re going to have to straighten them out, it’s better to
              give yourself some time to plan the best way to go about it.
            </p>

            <h2 class="code-line"> <a id="ch_6"></a>They establish boundaries
            </h2>
            <p class="has-line-data">This is the area where most people tend to sell themselves short. They feel like
              because they work or live with someone, they have no way to control the chaos. This couldn’t be further
              from the truth. Once you’ve found your way to rise above a person, you’ll begin to find their behavior
              more predictable and easier to understand. This will equip you to think rationally about when and where
              you have to put up with them and when you don’t. For example, even if you work with someone closely on a
              project team, that doesn’t mean that you need to have the same level of one-on-one interaction with them
              that you have with other team members.
              <br /><br />You can establish a boundary, but you’ll have to do so consciously and proactively. If you let
              things happen naturally, you are bound to find yourself constantly embroiled in difficult conversations.
              If you set boundaries and decide when and where you’ll engage a difficult person, you can control much of
              the chaos. The only trick is to stick to your guns and keep boundaries in place when the person tries to
              encroach upon them, which they will.

            </p>

            <h2 class="code-line"><a id="ch_7"></a> They won’t let anyone limit their joy
            </h2>
            <p class="has-line-data"> When your sense of pleasure and satisfaction are derived from the opinions of
              other people, you are no longer the master of your own happiness. When emotionally intelligent people feel
              good about something that they’ve done, they won’t let anyone’s opinions or snide remarks take that away
              from them.
              <br /><br />While it’s impossible to turn off your reactions to what others think of you, you don’t have
              to compare yourself to others, and you can always take people’s opinions with a grain of salt. That way,
              no matter what toxic people are thinking or doing, your self-worth comes from within. Regardless of what
              people think of you at any particular moment, one thing is certain: You’re never as good or bad as they
              say you are.
            </p>

            <h2 class="code-line"><a id="ch_8"></a>
              They don’t focus on problems—only solutions</h2>
            <p class="has-line-data"> Where you focus your attention determines your emotional state. When you fixate on
              the problems you’re facing, you create and prolong negative emotions and stress.
              When you focus on actions to better yourself and your circumstances, you create a sense of personal
              efficacy that produces positive emotions and reduces stress.
              When it comes to toxic people, fixating on how crazy and difficult they are gives them power over
              you.<br /><br /> Quit thinking about how troubling your difficult person is, and focus instead on how
              you’re going to go about handling them. This makes you more effective by putting you in control, and it
              will reduce the amount of stress you experience when interacting with them.
            </p>

            <h2 class="code-line"> <a id="ch_9"></a> They don’t forget
            </h2>
            <p class="has-line-data">Emotionally intelligent people are quick to forgive, but that doesn’t mean that
              they forget. Forgiveness requires letting go of what’s happened so that you can move on. It doesn’t mean
              you’ll give a wrongdoer another chance. Successful people are unwilling to be bogged down unnecessarily by
              others’ mistakes, so they let them go quickly and are assertive in protecting themselves from future harm.
            </p>

            <h2 class="code-line"> <a id="ch_10"></a> They squash negative self-talk.</h2>
            <p class="has-line-data">
              Sometimes you absorb the negativity of other people. There’s nothing wrong with feeling bad about how
              someone is treating you, but your self-talk (the thoughts you have about your feelings) can either
              intensify the negativity or help you move past it. Negative self-talk is unrealistic, unnecessary and
              self-defeating. It sends you into a downward emotional spiral that is difficult to pull out of. You should
              avoid negative self-talk at all costs.
            </p>

            <h2 class="code-line">
              <a id="ch_11"></a> They limit their caffeine intake
            </h2>

            <p class="has-line-data">
              Drinking caffeine triggers the release of adrenaline. Adrenaline is the source of the “fight-or-flight”
              response, a survival mechanism that forces you to stand up and fight or run for the hills when faced with
              a threat. The fight-or-flight mechanism sidesteps rational thinking in favor of a faster response. This is
              great when a bear is chasing you, but not so great when you’re surprised in the hallway by an angry
              co-worker.
            </p>

            <h2 class="code-line">
              <a id="ch_12"></a> They get some sleep
            </h2>

            <p class="has-line-data">
              I’ve beaten this one to death over the years and can’t say enough about the importance of sleep to
              increasing your emotional intelligence and managing your stress levels.
              When you sleep, your brain literally recharges, shuffling through the day’s memories and storing or
              discarding them (which causes dreams), so that you wake up alert and clear-headed.
              <br /><br /> Your self-control, attention and memory are all reduced when you don’t get enough—or the
              right kind—of sleep. Sleep deprivation raises stress hormone levels on its own, even without a stressor
              present.
              A good night’s sleep makes you more positive, creative and proactive in your approach to toxic people,
              giving you the perspective you need to deal effectively with them.
            </p>



            <h2 class="code-line">
              <a id="ch_13"></a>They use their support system
            </h2>

            <p class="has-line-data">
              It’s tempting, yet entirely ineffective, to attempt tackling everything by yourself. To deal with toxic
              people, you need to recognize the weaknesses in your approach to them. This means tapping into your
              support system to gain perspective on a challenging person.

              <br /><br />Everyone has someone at work and/or outside work who is on their team, rooting for them and
              ready to help them get the best from a difficult situation.
              Identify these individuals in your life and make an effort to seek their insight and assistance when you
              need it. Something as simple as explaining the situation can lead to a new perspective.
              Most of the time, other people can see a solution that you can’t because they are not as emotionally
              invested in the situation.
              <br /><br />
              Before you get this system to work brilliantly, you’re going to have to pass some tests. Most of the time,
              you will find yourself tested by touchy interactions with problem people.
              Thankfully, the plasticity of the brain allows it to mold and change as you practice new behaviors, even
              when you fail.
              Implementing these healthy, stress-relieving techniques for dealing with difficult people will train your
              brain to handle stress more effectively and decrease the likelihood of ill effects.
