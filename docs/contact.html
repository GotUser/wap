  <h3 class="code-line">
    1. Organization
  </h3>
  <p class="has-line-data">One of the most frequently mentioned habits of those who are successful in life is
    organization. Such organization includes planning as well as setting priorities and goals.</p>

  <p class="has-line-data">prioritize “To-Do List” every evening before going to bed to prepare for the next day. </p>


  <h3 class="code-line">2. Relaxation</h3>
  <p class="has-line-data">It’s interesting to note that relaxing – by meditating or simply avoiding distractions – is
    another of the most-often mentioned habits of successful people.
  </p>
  <p class="has-line-data">Of course, relaxation comes more easily to those who are organized, so perhaps for some, it
    is more of a natural byproduct than a conscious decision.
  </p>
  <p class="has-line-data">It may also be that the act of “taking a breath” is the successful person’s way of preparing
    for the effort yet to come. In fact, one of the first steps toward achieving a meditative or relaxed state is to
    concentrate on your own breathing for three to five minutes.
  </p>
  <h3 class="code-line">3. Taking Action</h3>
  <p class="has-line-data">Third on the list of habits of successful people is the inevitable “action” habit. It is
    important to organize, to plan, and to set priorities, but without action, a plan is nothing more than potential.
  </p>
  <p class="has-line-data">Successful people act – quickly and often. In addition, although it may sound
    counterintuitive, according to James Clear, they act (start, anyway) before they feel ready. While others come up
    with reasons not to act, successful people take that all-important first step – even if it seems outlandish.
  </p>
  <h3 class="code-line">4. Personal Care</h3>
  <p class="has-line-data">Personal care with regard to diet, exercise, and hygiene comes next on the list of habits of
    those who are successful.
  </p>

  <p class="has-line-data">For some, personal care involves a complex regimen and a highly disciplined lifestyle. For
    others, not so much. Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla Motors, put it succinctly when asked what daily habit has had the
    largest positive impact on his life. In a tweet, Musk said simply, “Showering.”
  </p>

  <h3 class="code-line">5. Positive Attitude</h3>
  <p class="has-line-data">According to many successful people, having a positive attitude is not just a result of being
    successful – it’s one of the root causes of success.
  </p>
  <p class="has-line-data">Joel Brown refers to gratitude and positive self-talk as priorities in the lives of the
    ultra-successful. Moreover, Brown says, it’s not enough to express gratitude and a positive attitude. You must also
    remind yourself why you are grateful in order to achieve a deeper effect.
  </p>
  <h3 class="code-line">6. Networking</h3>
  <p class="has-line-data">Successful people know the value of exchanging ideas with others through networking. They
    also know the value of collaboration and teamwork – all of which are likely when you network.
  </p>
  <p class="has-line-data">Successful people know the importance of surrounding themselves with other successful people,
    according to author Thomas Corley. Corley says 79% of wealthy people spend at least five hours a month networking.
  </p>
  <h3 class="code-line">7. Frugality</h3>
  <p class="has-line-data">Frugal is not the same as stingy. Frugality is a habit of being thrifty, with money and
    resources. It is also a habit of being economical. Learning to be economical comes through avoiding waste, which
    automatically results in efficiency.
  </p>
  <p class="has-line-data">Corley notes that wealthy, successful people avoid overspending. Instead, they
    comparison-shop and negotiate. The result, according to Corley, is financial success through the simple act of
    saving more money than they spend.
  </p>
  <h3 class="code-line">8. Rising Early</h3>
  <p class="has-line-data">The more time one can devote to being successful, the more likely success will result.
    Successful people are accustomed to rising early, and that habit appears repeatedly among those who do well in life.
  </p>
  <p class="has-line-data">While the “Early Riser’s Club” has a huge membership among successful people, a few notable
    members include Sir Richard Branson of Virgin Group, Disney CEO Robert Iger and Yahoo’s Marissa Mayer.
  </p>
  <h3 class="code-line">9. Sharing</h3>
  <p class="has-line-data">Whether through donating to charity or the sharing of ideas, successful people have a habit
    of giving. They know the value of sharing and most believe their success should result in something more than the
    accumulation of wealth for themselves.
  </p>
  <p class="has-line-data">Some of the most well-known successful philanthropists include Bill and Melinda Gates, Oprah
    Winfrey and Mark Zuckerberg.
  </p>
  <p class="has-line-data">Lack of wealth does not need to be a factor when it comes to sharing. Volunteering in your
    community or at a local school does not cost anything but could provide help where it is needed most, as
    KeepInspiring.Me points out.
  </p>
  <h3 class="code-line">10. Reading</h3>
  <p class="has-line-data">It's important to note that successful people read. While they also read for pleasure, most
    use their reading habit as a means to gain knowledge or insight.
  </p>
  <p class="has-line-data">For anyone who needs inspiration about the value and importance of reading, look no further
    than the example of billionaire author, J.K. Rowling, who says she read “anything” as a child. She advises, “Read as
    much as you possibly can. Nothing will help you as much as reading.”
  </p>
  <p class="has-line-data">The Bottom Line</p>
  <p class="has-line-data">Most people have habits – some are positive, some are not. Successful people tend to have
    more of the kinds of habits that contribute to their success.
  </p>
  <p class="has-line-data">The good news, for those who wish to be successful, is that cultivating positive habits takes
    no more effort than developing bad ones.
  </p>
  <p class="has-line-data">Some of the best habits of successful people involve only conscious effort, like getting up
    early every day. Others, such as becoming organized, may take a little more skill and practice but ultimately result
    in the most desired outcome of all – success.
