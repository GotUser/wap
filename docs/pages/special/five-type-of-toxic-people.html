            <h2 class="code-line"><a id="ch_1"></a> Introduction</h2>
            <p class="has-line-data">
              One of my favorite quotes is by Jim Rohn: “You are the average of the five people you spend the most time
              with.” These words opened my eyes to the fact that the people we hang out with, the people we call
              friends, they all have an influence on the decisions we make in life, and therefore the success we have
              (or don’t have).
              <br /><br />Unfortunately, not everyone pushes us to be better. Some people stop us from following our
              dreams or talk us out of taking a risk, and we don’t always realize that it’s happening. So it’s important
              to be aware and consciously choose who we spend time with, to limit spending time with toxic people—like
              these five personalities you should avoid when chasing goals.

            </p>


            <h2 class="code-line"><a id="ch_2"></a>
              1. The Complainers</h2>
            <p class="has-line-data">
              Complainers are people who are always complaining about how bad their life or job or whatever is. They
              constantly whine about everything but never do anything about it.
              <br /><br />
              Being around a complainer can take a toll on you—maybe you begin to join in on the complaints, and before
              you know it, you adopt their same way of negative thinking. That pessimism is contagious. Which is why you
              should think twice before sitting down with a complainer.

            </p>




            <h2 class="code-line"><a id="ch_3"></a>
              2. The Entitled</h2>
            <p class="has-line-data">
              These are the people who feel like they are entitled to certain things in life, like they do not have to
              work for anything, that the people around them owe them something. They are also the ones who will try to
              talk you out of following your dreams.
              <br /><br />
              This mindset can be deadly to a person trying to be successful. It blocks your determination and can kill
              your motivation in a heartbeat. Know this: You, or anyone else, are not entitled to anything. If you want
              the good life, you have to create it.

            </p>



            <h2 class="code-line"> <a id="ch_4"></a>
              3. The Conformers</h2>

            <p class="has-line-data">
              Conformers are the most popular of all. They are the ones who conform to the limits set on them. They do
              not have any dreams they are chasing after, and they are not doing something that goes against the status
              quo. They are simply living like robots—waking up, working 40 hours a week at a job they hate, going home,
              sleeping and doing it all over again.
              <br /><br />
              There are many people who are content with this, and that is perfectly fine. But a person who is following
              their dreams simply cannot conform to the average life. So while working your full-time job, put in the
              extra effort on the side to start building toward something that’s more in line with your dreams. And
              eventually you will be able to leave your day job to pursue your passion full time.

            </p>


            <h2 class="code-line"><a id="ch_5"></a> 4. The Party Animals</h2>
            <p class="has-line-data">
              They’re the one who’s planning happy hours five days a week, the one who lives to go out every night.
              Sure, the party animal might be fun, but beware—they can distract you from your dreams.
              <br /><br />
              Don’t get me wrong, you should take time to relax and clear your head on occasion, but bar hopping is not
              the solution and it’s not going to get you the life you’re after. By making partying a priority, you’re
              distracting yourself and breaking focus on your goals—things bigger than dollar beers and half-price apps.
              In order to grow as a person, you have to grow up first.

            </p>
            <h2 class="code-line"><a id="ch_5"></a> 5. The Doubters</h2>
            <p class="has-line-data">
              Doubters can be downers—they will listen to your big dreams, but they will be the first ones to tell you
              they don’t think it is a good idea or not to get your hopes up. They are the ones who believe you have to
              “be somebody” in order to do something extravagant.
              <br /><br />
              As somebody who is chasing their dreams, this can be very discouraging, so identifying the doubters in
              your group will be beneficial to you and your success in the future. Likewise, it is extremely important
              to keep supportive people around you, people who encourage you and lift your spirits when you are losing
              motivation.
              <br /><br />
              So, surround yourself with people who will support and encourage you to chase your dreams, through the
              good and the bad. Your success depends on it.
