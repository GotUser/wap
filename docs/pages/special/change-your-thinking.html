              <b><i>There is nothing on earth that you cannot have once you havementally accepted the fact that you can
                  have it.</i></b></p>
            <p>-<b>Robert Collier</b></p>
            <b>
              <li>THE TRUTH ABOUT YOU
            </b>
            <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYou are a thoroughly good person.You deserve a wonderful life, full of success,
              happiness, joy, and excitement.You are entitled to have happy relationships, excellent health, meaningful
              work, and financial independence. These are your birthright. This is what your life is meant to
              include.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYou are engineered for success and designed to have high levels of
              self-esteem, self-respect, and personal pride. You are extraordinary; there has never been anyone exactly
              like you in all the history of mankind on earth.You have absolutely amazing untapped talents and abilities
              that, when properly unleashed and applied, can bring you everything you could ever want in
              life.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYou are living at the greatest time in all of human history.You are
              surrounded by abundant opportunities that you can take advantage of to realize your dreams. The only real
              limits on what you can be, do, or have are the limits you place on yourself by your own thinking.Your
              future is virtually unlimited.<br>
              <li><b>GET REAL!</b>
                <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspHow did you react to the preceding three paragraphs? You probably had two
                  responses. First, you liked what they said, and your fondest wish was for them to be true for you. But
                  your second response was probably one of skepticism and disbelief. Even though you deeply desire to
                  live a wonderfully healthy, happy, prosperous life, when you read those words, your doubts and fears
                  arose immediately to remind you of reasons why these dreams and goals may not be possible for
                  you.Well, join the crowd!<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThis is exactly how I felt many years ago.
                  Even though I wanted to be a big success in life, I was unskilled, uneducated, and unemployed. I had
                  no idea what I could do to improve my situation. I felt trapped between big ideas on the one hand and
                  limited resources and opportunities on the other. Then I discovered a series of remarkable principles
                  that have been responsible for all the great successes and achievements of the ages, and my life
                  changed forever.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAfter proving these laws and principles in my own life,
                  I began speaking, and training others to apply the same ideas. Since then, I have given more than two
                  thousand talks and seminars as long as four days in length, in 24 countries, to a total of more than
                  two million participants. Most of them were also skeptical when they first heard these ideas of
                  optimism and possibility, until they learned what you are going to learn in the pages ahead. It
                  changed their lives, as it will change yours.
              <li><b>THE GREAT PRINCIPLE</b>
                <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspPerhaps the most important mental and spiritual principle ever discovered is
                  that <b><em>you become what you think about most of the time</em></b>.Your outer world is very much a
                  mirror image of your inner world.What is going on <b><em>outside</em></b> of you is a reflection of
                  what is going in <b><em>inside</em></b> of you.You can tell the inner condition of a person by looking
                  at the outer conditions of his or her life. And it cannot be otherwise.
              <li><b>THOUGHTS ARE THINGS</b>
                <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYour mind is extraordinarily powerful. Your thoughts control and determine
                  almost everything that happens to you. They can raise or lower your heart rate, improve or interfere
                  with your digestion, change the chemical composition of your blood, and help you to sleep or keep you
                  awake at night.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYour thoughts can make you happy or sad, sometimes in an
                  instant. They can make you alert and aware, or distracted and depressed. They can make you popular or
                  unpopular, confident or insecure, positive or negative. Your thoughts can make you feel powerful or
                  powerless, a victim or a victor, a hero or a coward. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In your material
                  life, your thoughts can make you a success or a failure, prosperous or poverty-stricken, respected or
                  ignored. Your thoughts, and the actions that they trigger, determine your whole life. And the best
                  news of all is that they are completely under your own control.<br>
              <li><b>THOUGHTS, FEELINGS, AND DESIRES</b>
                <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYou are a complex bundle of thoughts, feelings, attitudes, desires, images,
                  fears, hopes, doubts, opinions, and ambitions, each of them constantly changing, sometimes from second
                  to second. Each of these elements of your personality affects the others, sometimes in unpredictable
                  ways.Your entire life is the result of the intertwining and interconnecting of these
                  factors.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYour thoughts trigger images and pictures, and the emotions
                  that go with them. These images and emotions trigger attitudes and actions.Your actions then have
                  consequences and results that determine what happens to you.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIf you
                  think about success and confidence, you will feel strong and competent, and you will perform better at
                  whatever you attempt. If you think about making mistakes or being embarrassed, you will perform
                  poorly, no matter how good you really are.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspPictures and images, from
                  your imagination or from the external influences, produce ideas, emotions, and attitudes that
                  correspond to them. They then trigger actions that bring about certain results and outcomes.The
                  <em>thought</em> of a person or situation can cause you to instantly feel happy or sad, elated or
                  angry, loving or lonely.<br>
              <li><b>ATTITUDES, ACTIONS,AND EMOTIONS</b>
                <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYour attitudes, positive or negative, constructive or destructive, lead to
                  corresponding images, emotions, and actions that affect your life and relationships. Your attitudes,
                  in turn, are based on your previous experiences and your basic premises about how things are supposed
                  to be.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYour actions trigger the emotions and attitudes that go with
                  them. By the Law of Reversibility, you can actually act your way into feeling in a manner consistent
                  with the action. By acting as if you were already happy, positive, and confident, you soon begin to
                  feel that way on the inside. And your actions are under your direct control, whereas your emotions are
                  not.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn and of themselves, the outer aspects of your life are
                  <em>neutral.</em> It is only the <em>meaning</em> that you give to them that determines your
                  attitudes, opinions, emotions, and reactions to them. If you change your thinking about any part of
                  your life, you will change how you feel and behave in that area. And since only you can decide what to
                  think, you have the ability to take complete control over your life.<br>
              <li><b>QUESTION YOUR BELIEFS</b>
                <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe Law of Belief says:<em> Whatever you believe, with conviction, becomes
                    your reality.</em>You always act in a manner consistent with your deepest and most intensely held
                  beliefs, whether they are true or not. And all your beliefs are learned. At one time, you did not have
                  them.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYour beliefs largely determine your reality.You do not believe
                  what you <em>see</em>; you rather <em>see</em> what you already believe. You can have life-enhancing
                  beliefs that make you happy and optimistic, or you can have negative beliefs about yourself and your
                  potential that act as roadblocks to the realization of everything that is truly possible for
                  you.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe most harmful beliefs you can have are your <em>self-limiting
                    beliefs.</em> These are beliefs about yourself and your potential that hold you back. Most of them
                  are not true. Most of them are the result of information you have accepted without question, often
                  from early childhood. Even if it is completely untrue, if you <em>believe</em> yourself to be limited
                  in areas such as achieving wonderful health and happiness and earning a lot of money, that will become
                  your truth. As the author Richard Bach in his book <em>Illusions</em> wrote, 'Argue for your
                  limitations and sure enough, they're yours.'<br>
              <li><b>YOU ARE A LIVING MAGNET</b>
                <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe Law of Attraction says that you are a <em>'living magnet'</em> and that
                  <em>you invariably attract into your life the people, ideas, opportunities, and circumstances in
                    harmony with your dominant thoughts.</em><br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen you think positive,
                  optimistic, loving, and successful thoughts, you create a <em>force field</em> of magnetism that
                  attracts, like iron filings to a magnet, the very things you are thinking about. This law explains why
                  it is that you don't have to be concerned where your good is going to come from. If you can keep your
                  mind clearly focused on what you want, and refrain from thinking about what you <em>don't</em> want,
                  you will <em>attract</em> everything you need to achieve your goals, exactly when you are ready.
                  Change your thinking and you change your life.<br>
              <li><b>THE ONLY REAL MEASURE</b>
                <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspBertrand Russell, the English philosopher, once said, 'The very best proof
                  that something can be done is that others have already done it.' In the New Testament, Jesus taught
                  the way to measure the truth of any principle: 'By their fruits, ye shall know them.'<br><br>&nbsp
                  &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn other words, the only question you need to ask about any idea is, 'Does it work?'
                  Does it bring about the results that you desire? Milton Friedman, the Nobel prizewinning economist,
                  said, 'The only true measure of a theory or idea is your ability to make accurate predictions of the
                  future based on it.'<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe good news is that the ideas and principles you
                  are about to learn have been tested and proven in the lives and experiences of millions of people. In
                  themselves, like any principles of nature, they are <em>neutral</em>. Nature plays no favorites.
                  Nature treats everyone alike. Whatever seed you plant in the ground, nature will grow.Whatever
                  <em>thought seeds</em> you plant in your mind, nature will grow as well. It is entirely up to you.<br>
              <li><b>CHOOSE YOUR THOUGHTS</b>
                <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspSuccessful people are those who think more effectively than unsuccessful
                  people. They approach their lives, relationships, goals, problems, and experiences differently from
                  others. They sow better seeds, and as a result they reap better lives. If you learn to think and act
                  like other successful, happy, healthy, and prosperous people, you will soon enjoy the kind of lives
                  they do. When you change your thinking, you change your life.
                <p s><b><i>Nature understands no jesting. She is always true, always serious, always severe. She is
                      always right, and the errors and faults are always those of man. The man incapable of appreciating
                      her she despises, and only to the apt, the pure, and the true does she resign herself and reveal

              Chapter-1 Change Your Thinking</h2>

            <p class="has-line-data">
            <p>
              <b>
                <i>There is a law in psychology that if you form a picture in your mind of what you would like to be,
                  and you keep and hold that picture there long enough, you will soon become exactly as you have
                  been thinking.</i></b></p>
            <p> <b>- William James</b></p>
            <p><br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOnce upon a time there was a woman, about 30 years old, married with two
              children. Like many people, she had grown up in a home where she was constantly criticized and often
              treated
              unfairly by her parents. As a result, she developed deep feelings of inferiority and low self-esteem. She
              was negative and fearful, and had no confidence at all. She was shy and self-effacing, and did not
              consider
              herself to be particularly valuable or worthwhile. She felt that she was not really talented at anything.
              <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOne day, as she was driving to the store, another car went through a red
              light and smashed into her.When she awoke, she was in the hospital with a mild concussion and complete
              memory loss. She could still speak, but she had no recollection of any part of her past life. She was a
              total amnesiac. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAt first, the doctors thought it would be temporary. But
              weeks passed and no trace of her memory returned. Her husband and children visited her daily, but she did
              not know them. This was such an unusual case that other doctors and specialists came to visit her as well,
              to test her and ask her questions about her condition. <br><br>
              <li><b>STARTING OVER</b>
                <p><br>Eventually, she went home, her memory a complete blank. Determined to understand what had
                  happened to her, she began reading medical textbooks and studying in the specialized area of
                  amnesia and memory loss. She met and spoke with specialists in this field. Eventually she wrote
                  a paper on her condition. Not long afterward, she was invited to address a medical convention to
                  deliver her paper, answer questions about her amnesia, and share her experiences and ideas on
                  neurological functioning. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspDuring this period, something amazing
                  happened. <em>She became a new person completely.</em> All the attention in the hospital and
                  afterward made her feel valuable, important, and truly loved by her family. The attention and
                  acclaim she received from members of the medical profession built her self-esteem and
                  self-respect even higher. She became a genuinely positive, confident, outgoing woman, highly
                  articulate, well informed, and very much in demand as a speaker and authority in the medical
                  profession. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAll memory of her negative childhood had been wiped
                  out. Her feelings of inferiority were wiped out as well. She became a new person. She changed
                  her thinking and changed her life. <br><br>
              <li><b>THE BLANK SLATE</b>
                <p><br>The Scottish philosopher David Hume was the first to propose the idea of the tabula rasa or
                  blank slate.This theory says that each person comes into the world with no thoughts or ideas at
                  all, and everything that a person thinks and feels is learned from infancy onward. It is as
                  though the child's mind is a blank slate that every passing person and experience leaves a mark
                  on.The adult becomes the sum total of everything he or she learns, feels, and experiences
                  growing up.What the adult does and becomes later is the result of this early conditioning. As
                  Aristotle wrote, ''Whatever is impressed is expressed.'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspPerhaps
                  the greatest breakthrough in the field of human potential in the twentieth century was the
                  discovery of the <em>self-concept.</em> This is the idea that each person develops a bundle of
                  beliefs regarding oneself, starting at birth. Your self-concept then becomes the master program
                  of your subconscious computer, determining everything you think, say, feel, and do. For this
                  reason, all change in your outer life begins with a change in your self-concept, with a change
                  in the way you think and feel about yourself and your world. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe
                  child is born with no self-concept at all. Every idea, opinion, feeling, attitude, or value you
                  have as an adult you learned from childhood. Everything you are today is the result of an idea
                  or impression you took in and accepted as true.When you believe something to be true, it becomes
                  true for you, whatever the fact may be. ''You are not what you think you are, but what you
                  think, you are.'' <br><br>
              <li><b>FIRST IMPRESSIONS ARE LASTING</b>
                <p><br>If you were raised by parents who continually told you what a good person you were, who loved
                  you, encouraged you, supported you, and believed in you, no matter what you did or didn't do,
                  you would grow up with the belief that you were a good and valuable person. By the age of three,
                  this belief would <em>lock in</em> and become a fundamental part of the way you view yourself in
                  relation to your world. Thereafter, no matter what happens to you, you would hold to this
                  belief. It would become your reality. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIf you were raised by
                  parents who did not know how powerful their words and behaviors could be in shaping your
                  personality, they could very easily have used destructive criticism, disapproval, and physical
                  or emotional punishment to discipline or control you. When a child is continually criticized at
                  an early age, he soon concludes that there is something wrong with him. He doesn't understand
                  why it is that he is being criticized or punished, but he assumes that his parents know the
                  truth about him, and that he deserves it. He begins to feel that he is not valuable or lovable.
                  He is not worth very much. He must therefore be worthless. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAlmost
                  all personality problems in adolescence and adulthood are rooted in what psychologists refer to
                  as <em>love withheld.</em> The child needs love like roses need rain. When children feel
                  unloved, they feel unsafe and insecure. They think, ''I'm not good enough.'' They begin to
                  engage in compensatory behaviors to make up for this inner anxiety. This sense of love
                  deprivation is manifested in misbehavior, personality problems, bursts of anger, depression,
                  hopelessness, lack of ambition, and problems with people and relationships. <br><br>
              <li><b>YOU ARE BORN UNAFRAID</b>
                <p><br>The child is born with no fears, except those of falling and loud noises. All other fears have
                  to be taught to the child as he or she grows up. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe two major
                  fears we all develop are the fear of <em>failure</em> or <em>loss</em> and the fear of
                  <em>criticism</em> or <em>rejection</em>.We begin to learn the fear of failure if we are
                  continually criticized and punished when we try something new or different.We are shouted at and
                  told, ''No! Get away from there! Stop that! Put that down!'' Physical punishment and the
                  withholding of love, possibilities that scare us and make us feel insecure, often accompany
                  these shouts and criticisms. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWe soon begin to believe that we are
                  too small, too weak, incompetent, inadequate, and incapable of doing anything new or different.
                  We express this feeling with the words, ''I can't, I can't, I can't.''Whenever we think about
                  doing something new or challenging, we automatically respond with feelings of fear, trembling,
                  and a churning stomach.We react exactly as if we are afraid of getting a spanking.We say, ''I
                  can't'' over and over. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe fear of failure is the primary reason
                  for failure in adult life. As the result of destructive criticism in childhood, we hold
                  ourselves back as adults. We sell ourselves short. We quit before we even try the first time.
                  Instead of using our amazing minds to figure out how to get what we want, we use our reasoning
                  ability to create reasons why we can't, and why the things we want are not possible for us.
                  <br><br>
              <li><b>THE NEED TO BE LOVED</b>
                <p><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe second major fear that holds us back, undermines our confidence, and
                  destroys our desire for a happy life is the fear of <em>rejection,</em> and its expression,
                  <em>criticism</em>. This emotion is learned in early childhood as the result of our parents
                  expressing disapproval of us whenever we do something they don't like, or don't do something
                  that they expect. As a result of our displeasing them, they become angry and withdraw the love
                  and approval we need so much as children. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe fear of being
                  unloved and alone is so traumatic for a child that she soon conforms her behavior to do whatever
                  she thinks her parents will approve of. She loses her spontaneity and uniqueness. She begins to
                  think, ''I have to! I have to! I have to!'' She concludes, ''I have to do whatever Mommy and
                  Daddy want me to, or they won't love me, and I'll be all alone!'' <br><br>
              <li><b>CONDITIONAL LOVE</b>
                <p><br>As an adult, a child raised with what is called ''conditional love'' (as opposed to
                  unconditional love, the greatest gift one person can give to another) becomes hypersensitive to
                  the opinions of others. In its extreme form, he cannot do anything if there is the slightest
                  chance that someone else may not approve. He projects his childhood relationship with his
                  parents onto the important people in his adult life-spouse, boss, relatives, friends, authority
                  figures-and tries desperately to earn their approval, or at least not lose it. <br><br>&nbsp
                  &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe fears of failure and rejection, caused by destructive criticism in early
                  childhood, are the root causes of most of our unhappiness and anxiety as adults. We feel, ''I
                  can't!'' or ''I have to!'' continually. The worst feeling is when we feel, ''I can't, but I have
                  to!'' or ''I have to, but I can't!'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWe want to do something, but
                  we are afraid of failure or loss, or if we are not afraid of loss, we are afraid of disapproval.
                  We want to do something to improve our lives, at work or at home, but we are afraid that we may
                  fail, or that someone else may criticize us, or both. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspFor most
                  people, their fears govern their lives. Everything they do is organized around avoiding failure
                  or criticism. They think continually about playing it safe, rather than striving for their
                  goals. They seek security rather than opportunity. <br><br>
              <li><b>DOUBLE YOUR RATE OF FAILURE</b>
                <p><br>The author Arthur Gordon once approached Thomas J.Watson Sr., the founder of IBM, and asked him
                  how he could succeed faster as a writer. Thomas J.Watson, one of the giants of American
                  business, replied with these profound words: ''If you want to be successful faster, you must
                  double your rate of failure. Success lies on the far side of failure.'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                  &nbsp &nbspThe fact is that the more you have already failed, the more likely it is you are on
                  the verge of great success. Your failures have prepared you to succeed.This is why a streak of
                  good luck seems to follow a streak of bad luck. When in doubt, ''double your rate of
                  failure.''The more things you <em>try</em>, the more likely you are to <em>triumph.</em> You
                  overcome your fears only by doing the thing you fear until the fear has no more control over
                  you. <br><br>
              <li><b>YOUR MENTAL HARD DRIVE</b>
                <p><br>Everything you know about yourself, all your beliefs, are recorded on the hard drive of your
                  personality, in your self-concept. Your self-concept precedes and predicts your levels of
                  performance and effectiveness in everything you do. Because of the law of correspondence, you
                  always behave on the outside in a manner consistent with your self-concept on the inside. All
                  improvement in your life therefore begins with an improvement in your self-concept.
                  <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYou have an <em>overall</em> self-concept that is made up of all
                  your beliefs about yourself and your abilities. This bundle of beliefs includes all the
                  experiences, decisions, successes, failures, ideas, information, emotions, and opinions of your
                  life up to now. This general self-concept determines how and what you think and feel about
                  yourself, and measures how well you are doing in general. <br><br>
              <li><b>YOUR MINI-SELF-CONCEPTS</b>
                <p><br>You have a series of ''mini-self-concepts'' as well. These mini-selfconcepts combine to make up
                  your overall self-concept.You have a self-concept for every area of your life that you consider
                  important. This mini-self-concept determines how you think, feel, and perform in that area.
                  <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspFor example, you have a self-concept for how healthy and fit you
                  are, and how much you eat or exercise.You have a self-concept for how likable and popular you
                  are with others, especially with members of the opposite sex.You have a self-concept for what
                  kind of a spouse or parent you are, for how good a friend you are to your friends, how smart you
                  are, and how well you learn.You have a selfconcept for every sport you play, and for every
                  activity you engage in, including how well you drive your car. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                  &nbspYou have a self-concept for how well you do your work, and for how well you do each part of
                  your work. You have a selfconcept for how much money you make and how well you save and invest
                  it. This is a critical area. The fact is that you can never earn much more or less than your
                  self-concept level of income. If you want to make more money, you have to change your beliefs
                  about yourself relative to income and money. This is an important part of this book. <br><br>
              <li><b>CHANGE YOUR BELIEFS</b>
                <p><br>In every case, if you want to change your performance and your results in any area of your
                  life, you have to change your selfconcept- or your beliefs about yourself-for that area.
                  Fortunately, your beliefs are largely subjective. They are not always based on facts. Instead,
                  they are based largely on information you have taken in and accepted as true, sometimes with
                  very little evidence or proof. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe very worst beliefs you can
                  have are <em>self-limiting beliefs</em> of any kind. These are beliefs about yourself that cause
                  you to feel somehow limited or deficient in a particular area. These beliefs are seldom true,
                  but if you accept them as valid estimates of your ability, they become true for you, exactly as
                  if they were correct. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe starting point of unlocking your
                  potential, and accomplishing more than you ever have before, is for you to <em>challenge </em>
                  your selflimiting beliefs. You begin this process of freeing yourself from self-limiting beliefs
                  by imagining that, whatever they are, they are completely untrue. Imagine for the moment that
                  you have no limitations on your abilities at all. Imagine that you could be, do, or have
                  anything you really wanted in life. Imagine that your potential is unlimited in any way.
                  <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspFor example, imagine that you could be earning twice as much as
                  you are earning today. Imagine that you could be living in a bigger house, driving a better car,
                  and enjoying a more expensive lifestyle. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspImagine that you have
                  the ability to be one of the top people in your field. Imagine that you are one of the most
                  popular, powerful, and persuasive personalities in your social and business world. Imagine that
                  you are calm, confident, and unafraid of anything. Imagine that you could set and achieve any
                  goal you put your mind to. This is how you begin changing your thinking and changing your life.
                  <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe starting point of eliminating your fears, and releasing your
                  potential, is to reprogram your mental hard drive with new, positive, constructive, and
                  courageous beliefs about yourself and your future. Throughout this book, you will learn how to
                  do this. <br><br>
              <li><b>THREE PARTS OF YOUR SELF-CONCEPT</b>
                <p><br>Your self-concept has three parts, like a pie divided into three wedges. Each is linked with
                  each of the others. All three elements together make up your personality.They largely determine
                  what you think, feel, and do, and everything that happens to you. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                  &nbspYour <em>self-ideal</em> is the first part of your personality and your selfconcept. Your
                  self-ideal is made up of all of your hopes, dreams, visions, and ideals.Your self-ideal is
                  composed of the virtues, values, and qualities that you most admire in yourself and others. Your
                  self-ideal is the person you would most like to become, if you could be a perfect person in
                  every way. These ideals guide and shape your behavior. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspGreat men
                  and women, leaders, and people of character are very clear about their values, visions, and
                  ideals. They know who they are and what they believe in.They set high standards for themselves,
                  and they don't compromise those standards. They are men and women that others can look up to and
                  depend on.They are definite and distinct in their interactions with others. In everything they
                  do, they strive to live up to their ideals. <br><br>
              <li><b>THE WAY YOU SEE YOURSELF</b>
                <p><br>The second part of your self-concept is your <em>self-image.</em> This is the way you see
                  yourself and think about yourself. It is often called your ''inner mirror.'' It is where you
                  look internally to see how you should behave in a particular situation. Because of the power of
                  your self-image, you always perform on the <em>outside</em> consistent with the picture you have
                  of yourself on the <em>inside.</em> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe discovery of the
                  self-image, pioneered by Maxwell Maltz, is a major breakthrough in understanding human
                  performance and effectiveness. By visualizing and imagining yourself performing at your best in
                  an upcoming situation, you send a message to your subconscious mind.Your subconscious mind
                  accepts this message as a command, and then coordinates your thoughts, words, and actions so
                  that they fit a pattern consistent with the picture you created. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                  &nbspAll improvement in your life begins with an improvement in your mental pictures.Your
                  internal images influence your emotions, your behaviors, your attitudes, and even the way other
                  people respond to you. The development of a positive self-image is a vital part of changing your
                  thinking and changing your life. <br><br>
              <li><b>HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT YOURSELF</b>
                <p><br>The third part of your self-concept is your <em>self-esteem.</em> This is the emotional
                  component of your personality, and is the most important factor in determining how you think,
                  feel, and behave. Your level of self-esteem largely determines much of what happens to you in
                  life. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYour self-esteem is best defined as <i>how much you like
                    yourself.</i> The more you like yourself, the better you perform at anything you attempt.
                  And by the law of reversibility, the better you perform, the more you like yourself.
                  <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYour self-esteem is the ''reactor core'' of your personality. It
                  is the energy source that determines your levels of confidence and enthusiasm. The more you like
                  yourself, the higher will be the standards you will set for yourself. The more you like
                  yourself, the bigger the goals you will set for yourself and the longer you will persist in
                  achieving them. People with high self-esteem are virtually unstoppable. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                  &nbsp &nbspYour level of self-esteem determines the quality of your relationships with others.
                  The more you like and respect yourself, the more you like and respect others and the better they
                  feel toward you. In your business life and career, your personal level of self-esteem will be
                  the critical factor that determines whether or not people will buy from you, hire you, enter
                  into business dealings with you, and even lend you money. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe
                  better your self-esteem, the better you will be as a spouse and parent. High self-esteem parents
                  raise high self-esteem children. These children develop high levels of self-confidence and
                  associate with other high self-esteem children. High self-esteem homes are characterized by
                  love, laughter, and happiness for everyone who lives there. <br><br>
              <li><b>THE DETERMINANT OF SELF-ESTEEM</b>
                <p><br>Your level of self-esteem is largely determined by how closely your self-image - your current
                  performance and behavior - matches your self-ideal - your picture of how you would perform if
                  you were at your very best.You are always comparing your actual performance with your ideal
                  performance at an unconscious level.Whenever you feel that you are living up to your very best,
                  you feel terrific about yourself.Your self-esteem soars.You feel happy and fulfilled.
                  <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhenever you do or say something that is not in keeping with your
                  ideals or the best of which you feel you are capable, your selfesteem goes down.Whenever there
                  is a wide separation between the person you are in the moment and the ideal person you want very
                  much to be in the future, you feel badly about yourself. This is why you get angry with yourself
                  whenever you fail at something, or behave badly in a situation with other people.Your self-ideal
                  continually reminds you of how much better a person you can be. <br><br>
              <li><b>THE CORE OF PERSONALITY</b>
                <p><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspPsychologists agree today that your self-esteem lies at the core of your
                  self-concept and your personality. Every improvement in any part of your personality or
                  performance boosts your self-esteem, and causes you to like and respect yourself even more. The
                  more you like yourself, the better will be your self-image and subsequent performance, and the
                  faster you will move toward becoming more like your self-ideal. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                  &nbspThe best news of all is that there is an <i>inverse relationship</i> between your level of
                  self-esteem and your fears of failure and rejection. The more you like yourself, the less you
                  fear failure. The more you like yourself, the less concerned you are with the opinions of
                  others, and the less you fear criticism. The more you like yourself, the more you make your
                  decisions based on your own goals and standards, and the less you care what others think or say.
                  <br><br>
              <li><b>CONTROL YOUR INNER DIALOGUE</b>
                <p><br>Just as you become what <i>you think about, you also become what you say to yourself.</i> The
                  most powerful words you can repeat to yourself, especially if you are feeling tense or uneasy
                  about an upcoming event, are the words, ''I like myself! I like myself! I like myself!''
                  <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhenever you say, ''I like myself!'' your fears diminish and your
                  courage increases. The words, ''I like myself!'' are so powerful and positive that they are
                  immediately accepted by your subconscious mind as a command. They instantly affect your
                  thoughts, feelings, and attitudes.Your body language immediately improves, and you stand
                  straighter.Your face becomes more positive and cheerful.Your tone of voice becomes stronger and
                  more confident.You feel better about yourself, and as a result, you treat everyone around you in
                  a warmer, friendlier way. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYou begin the process of changing your
                  thinking and changing your life by going to work on your self-concept.You start by developing a
                  clear, positive, exciting, and inspiring self-ideal, consistent with the very best person you
                  can imagine yourself becoming. You develop a positive self-image by imagining yourself
                  performing at your very best in everything you do. Finally, you develop high and unshakable
                  levels of self-esteem by loving and accepting yourself unconditionally as a valuable and
                  worthwhile person. <br><br>
              <li><b>EXAMINE YOUR BASIC PREMISES</b>
                <p><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspMost of your thoughts and your responses to the events and people of
                  your life are determined by your <i>basic premises.</i> These are the ideas, beliefs, opinions,
                  and conclusions you have come to as the result of inputs and experiences starting in
                  childhood.They constitute not only your self-concept, but also your <i>philosophy of
                    life</i>.The more adamant and convinced you are of your basic premises, the more they
                  predict and control everything you do, say, and feel. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIf you
                  believe yourself to be an excellent person, loaded with talent and ability, friendly and
                  popular, healthy and energetic, curious and creative, and destined to have a wonderful life,
                  these basic premises will lead you to set goals, work hard, develop yourself, treat others well,
                  bounce back from adversity, and ultimately succeed. Nothing will be able to stop you in the long
                  run. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIt is not what happens to you in life that is important. It
                  is only <i>how you react</i> to what happens. It doesn't matter where you're coming from,
                  either. All that really matters is where you are going. And where you are going is limited only
                  by your own imagination. And since your imagination is unlimited, your future is unlimited as
                  well. These are the basic premises and beliefs you need to fulfill your potential. <br><br>
              <li><b>DISSOLVING THE MYTHS</b>
                <p><br>Unfortunately, there are several myths that we accept as we grow up that can sabotage our hopes
                  for success, joy, and fulfillment later in life. Let's look at these self-limiting beliefs one
                  at a time. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe first and worst is summarized in the feeling,
                  ''I'm not good enough.'' This is the basic premise that causes feelings of inferiority and
                  inadequacy.We assume that other people are better than we are just because, at the moment, they
                  are doing better than we are.We feel that they must be worth more than us. Therefore, we must be
                  worth less than them. This feeling of worthlessness sits deep in the psyche and causes us to
                  sell ourselves short.We settle for less than we are truly capable of. Rather than to fail at a
                  new goal, we don't set it in the first place. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe correct basic
                  premise for you to develop, or belief for you to have, is that not only are you good enough, but
                  you have the ability to be excellent in any area that is important to you.You have unlimited
                  potential to be, do, and have more than you have ever achieved up to now. As William Shakespeare
                  said in The Tempest, ''What's past is prologue.''Whatever you have accomplished in the past is
                  only a hint of what you can do in the future. <br><br>
              <li><b>TALK TO YOURSELF POSITIVELY</b>
                <p><br>The most powerful words in your vocabulary are the words that you say to yourself and
                  believe.Your self-talk, your inner dialogue, determines 95 percent of your emotions.When you
                  talk to yourself, your subconscious mind accepts these words as commands. It then adjusts your
                  behavior, your self-image, and your body language to fit a pattern consistent with those words.
                  <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspFrom now on, talk to yourself only in terms of what you want to
                  be and do. <i>Refuse to say anything about yourself that you do not sincerely desire to be
                    true.</i>. Repeat the powerful, positive words, ''I can do it!'' over and over. Prior to
                  any event of importance, repeat the words, ''I like myself!'' Say, ''I'm the best! I'm the best!
                  I'm the best!'' again and again like you really mean it.Then, stand up straight and strong, put
                  a confident smile on your face, and do the very best of which you are capable. Soon it will
                  become a habit. <br><br>
              <li><b>YOU DESERVE THE BEST</b>
                <p><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAs the result of previous destructive criticism, people accept another
                  myth, or self-limiting belief. It is that they don't really believe that they deserve to be
                  successful. This deep inner feeling of undeservingness is quite common among those of us who
                  started off with very little in life, or who came from families that had little money when we
                  were growing up. It can also be caused by people who told us at a young age that to be poor is
                  virtuous but to be rich is sinful. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIf you have grown up feeling
                  undeserving of good things, for any reason, and you do achieve success in your field, you may
                  experience what is called the ''imposter syndrome.''You will feel that you are an imposter in
                  your success, and that you are going to be found out. No matter how successful you become as the
                  result of your hard work, you will have a nagging fear that it will all be taken away from you.
                  <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIf you feel like an imposter, you will often feel guilty for
                  achieving greater success than others. To escape these feelings of guilt, many people engage in
                  self-sabotage. They eat too much, drink too much, take dope, ignore their families, engage in
                  unpredictable behaviors, and often throw their money away in extravagant living and unwise
                  investments. They feel deep down inside that they don't deserve their success. As a result, they
                  often drive it away. <br><br>
              <li><b>DEDICATE YOURSELF TO SERVING OTHERS</b>
                <p><br>The truth is that you deserve everything you can rightfully earn by doing an excellent job, and
                  producing or distributing products or services that improve people's lives and work. In a market
                  society such as ours, all transactions are <i>voluntary.</i> People buy something only if they
                  feel that they are going to be better off as a result.You can therefore be successful in the
                  long run only by providing people with the things they want to improve their lives and work. The
                  more and better you serve other people, the more you both deserve and earn. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                  &nbsp &nbspThe word ''deserve'' comes from the two Latin words, ''de-'' which means ''from'' and
                  ''servire'' which means ''to serve.'' Therefore, the word ''deserve'' means ''from service.''
                  The people who do the best in our society, with few exceptions, are those who are serving other
                  people better than someone else.Your whole focus in your career should be on serving other
                  people better. Then you will deserve every dollar you earn. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                  &nbspAbraham Lincoln once said, ''The very best way to help the poor is not to become one of
                  them.'' In our society, the more financially successful you are, the more taxes you are likely
                  to pay. These taxes help pay for the schools, hospitals, roads, welfare, Medicare, military
                  expenditures, and all the important things that our society offers.You can be proud to be
                  financially successful. By making a lot of money, you make a significant contribution to lots of
                  people.You do well for yourself by doing well for others. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspRepeat
                  the words, ''I deserve every penny I earn as the result of serving others with the products and
                  services they need to improve their lives. I am proud of my success.'' <br><br>
              <li><b>YOU ARE AN EXCELLENT PERSON</b>
                <p><br><i>You are a thoroughly good person.You are honest, decent, truthful, and hardworking.You treat
                    other people with courtesy, respect, and warmth. You are dedicated to your family,
                    friends, and your company.You are strong, confident, and responsible.You are
                    knowledgeable, intelligent, and experienced.You are important not only to the people
                    closest to you, but also to your community.You were born for a special reason, and you
                    have a great destiny to fulfill.You are an excellent person in every way.</i>
                  <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe preceding paragraph is a statement of your real personality
                  and character. It may not be true for you 100 percent of the time, but it is a good general
                  description of who you really are inside, and where you are going with your life. When you
                  unconditionally accept that you are a truly valuable and worthwhile person, you will express it
                  in everything you say and do. Over time, it will become true for you.Your ideal will become your
                  reality. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspRepeat to yourself, ''I like myself and l love my life.
                  I am a thoroughly good person in every way, and I always do my very best at anything I
                  attempt.'' <br><br>
              <li><b>THE MENTAL SOFTWARE STORE</b>
                <p><br>Imagine that there was a store that sold mental programming.You could purchase any
                  self-concept, belief, or attitude that you wanted and install it in your brain, and that is the
                  person you would be from then on. If such a store existed, and you could buy any set of beliefs,
                  what would you choose? <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspHere is a suggestion. Look around you and
                  find out what the happiest and most successful people in your world have developed as their core
                  beliefs, and then get the same set of beliefs for yourself. Load them onto your mental hard
                  drive and start running the same programs they are running. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                  &nbspFortunately, based on hundreds of interviews with successful people, we know exactly how
                  they are programmed and what beliefs they have developed from an early age.The most important
                  core belief you can adopt for yourself is this: ''I am a thoroughly good person and I am going
                  to be a big success in life. Everything that happens to me, good or bad, is simply a part of the
                  process of achieving the great success and happiness that is inevitable for me.'' <br><br>&nbsp
                  &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIf you absolutely believed that you were guaranteed to be happy and successful,
                  and that every setback or obstacle was sent to you to teach you important lessons that you
                  needed to know to achieve your goals, you would be completely unstoppable. You would be positive
                  and optimistic most of the time.You would set big goals for yourself and bounce back quickly
                  from any temporary defeat.Your belief would eventually become your reality. By changing your
                  thinking, you would change your life. <br><span>

                <ol><br>
                  <li>Define your ideals clearly. If you could be an excellent person in every way, what qualities
                    would you have? How would you behave? <br><br>
                  <li>You become what you think about most of the time. Identify one or more areas of your life
                    where your thinking is having a major influence on your emotions, attitudes, or actions.
                    <br><br>
                  <li>In what area of activity do you perform at your best? How do you visualize yourself in that

                  <li>You are a thoroughly good person. From this day forth, see yourself as the very best you can
                    be, and refuse to accept any limitations on your possibilities. <br><br>

            <p> <b><i>If you paint in your mind a picture of bright and happy expectations, you put yourself into a
                  condition conducive to your goals.</i></b></p>
            <p> <b>- Norman Vincent Peale</b></p>
            <p> <br><br>The way you think and feel about yourself, including your beliefs and expectations about what is
              possible for you, determines everything you do and everything that happens to you.When you change the
              quality of your thinking, you change the quality of your life, sometimes instantly. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
              &nbsp &nbspYou have complete control over only one thing in the universe - your thinking! You can decide
              what you are going to think in any given situation.Your thoughts and the way you interpret any event
              trigger your feelings - positive or negative.Your thoughts and feelings lead to your actions and determine
              the results you get. It all starts with your thoughts. <br><br>
              <li><b>POSITIVE THINKING</b>
                <p> <br>Positive thoughts are life enhancing. They <i>empower</i> you and make you feel stronger and
                  more confident. Positive thinking is not just a motivational idea. It has measurable, constructive
                  effects on your personality, your health, your levels of energy, and your creativity. The more
                  positive and optimistic you are, the happier you will be in every area of your life. <br><br>&nbsp
                  &nbsp &nbsp &nbspNegative thoughts bring about the opposite. They <i>disempower</i> you and make you
                  feel weaker and less confident. Whenever you think or say something negative, you give your power
                  away. You feel angry and defensive. You feel frustrated and unhappy. Over time, negative thinking can
                  make you physically ill, and even poison your relationships. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspPositive
                  thinking leads to mental health and peak performance. Negative thinking leads to mental illness and
                  decreased effectiveness. Your goal, therefore, if you want to live a wonderful life, is to cultivate
                  positive emotions and get rid of negative emotions. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe elimination of
                  negative emotions is the most important single step you can take toward health, happiness, and
                  personal wellbeing. Each time you take complete control over your thoughts and feelings, and
                  discipline yourself to keep them positive, the quality of both your inner and outer lives improves. In
                  the absence of negative emotions, your mind automatically fills with the positive emotions that
                  generate feelings of happiness and fulfillment. <br><br>
              <li><b>YOU CAN CHOOSE YOUR THOUGHTS</b>
                <p> <br>The Law of Substitution says, <i>''Your mind can hold only one thought at a time, positive or
                    negative.You can substitute a positive thought for a negative thought whenever you choose.''</i> You
                  can apply this law by deliberately thinking about something positive whenever you want to cancel out a
                  thought or feeling that makes you angry or unhappy. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe Law of Habit
                  says, <i>''Any thought or action that you repeat over and over will eventually become a new
                    habit.''</i> When you repeatedly react and respond in a positive way, you take full control over
                  your conscious mind. Soon it becomes automatic and easy to think and act in that manner. By using
                  willpower and repetition, you develop new habits of thinking and acting. By applying this law, you can
                  become a completely positive person and change your life. <br><br>
              <li><b>STARVE YOUR NEGATIVE EMOTIONS</b>
                <p> <br>Your negative emotions have all been learned, beginning in childhood. And what has been learned
                  can be unlearned, sometimes quite quickly.You can learn any habit or skill that you consider to be
                  either desirable or necessary. Especially, you can learn positive, constructive ways of thinking about
                  people, money, health, and other factors to cancel out negative ideas that limit your potential and
                  interfere with your success. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspMany negative ideas or attitudes are based
                  on false premises. Sometimes a negative idea about a subject, or a negative attitude toward a person,
                  can be completely reversed with a single piece of new information. You could suddenly learn that an
                  idea you had about yourself or another person was not true. As a result, you could change your
                  thinking in an instant. Be open to this possibility. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspNegative emotions
                  exist only because we give them life and then keep them alive. We feed them by continually thinking
                  and talking about things that make us angry or unhappy. Fortunately, you can change this situation by
                  applying the Law of Emotion. This law states, <i>''A stronger emotion will dominate and override a
                    weaker emotion, and whichever emotion you concentrate on grows and becomes stronger.''</i>
                  <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhat this means is that whatever emotion you dwell upon grows and
                  eventually dominates your thinking in that area. If you withdraw your mental energy from a person or
                  situation that makes you sad or angry by refusing to think about it, the emotion connected with that
                  situation eventually dies away. Like a fire with no fuel, it goes out. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                  &nbspYou have experienced this many times already. For example, as we grow up, we have relationships
                  with the opposite sex. Most of them do not work out over time.When they end, we are often emotionally
                  distressed and hurt.We are often sad, angry, depressed, preoccupied, and unhappy. These feelings last
                  for a certain period. Then we recover.We meet someone else. Gradually we forget about the unhappy
                  ending of the earlier relationship. Months or years later, we look back or even meet the other person,
                  and we cannot imagine how emotionally involved we were with him or her. Because we did not feed them,
                  the feelings have died away completely. This is an example of the laws of substitution and emotion in
                  action in your own life. <br><br>
              <li><b>THE SOURCES OF NEGATIVE EMOTIONS</b>
                <p> <br>There are four basic causes of negative emotions. According to the Russian philosopher Peter
                  Ouspensky, in his book In Search of the Miraculous, these are: (1) justification; (2) identification,
                  (3) inward considering, and (4) blame. The greatest leap forward in changing your thinking and
                  changing your life will take place when you systematically eliminate all four of these causes of
                  negative emotions from your life. <br><br>
              <li><b>STOP JUSTIFYING</b>
                <p> <br>Justification is what you do when you rationalize or create a reason for your anger and
                  unhappiness.You tell yourself, and whoever else will listen, how badly you were treated and how
                  dreadfully the other person behaved. You continually rehash the situation in your mind.You repeat all
                  the reasons you have for being upset. Each time you think of the person or situation, you become
                  angry.You feel entitled to your anger, as if you have paid a high price for it, especially since, in
                  your estimation, you were such a good and virtuous person. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe way you
                  short-circuit the natural tendency toward justification and rationalization is by refusing to engage
                  in it. Instead, you stop justifying.You use your marvelous mind to think of reasons not to justify
                  your negative emotions. Remember, your negative emotions do you no good. They are totally destructive.
                  They do not affect the other person or change the situation. They simply undermine your happiness and
                  self-confidence, making you weaker and less effective in other areas of your life. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                  &nbsp &nbspInstead of justifying your anger and unhappiness, you should use your intelligence and
                  imagination to excuse the other person, or to let go of the unhappy situation. For example, if someone
                  cuts you off in traffic, instead of becoming angry, you say,''Well, I'd better be more careful next
                  time,'' ''I guess he is having a bad day,'' or ''He must be late for an important appointment.''
                  <br><br>
              <li><b>MAKE EXCUSES FOR OTHERS</b>
                <p> <br>Since your mind can hold only one thought at a time, the instant you start excusing the other
                  person you withdraw the energy or fuel that the negative emotions of anger and resentment require to
                  get going and stay burning.You reassert your mental control. You keep yourself calm and positive. In a
                  little while, the situation passes and you forget all about it. By substituting a positive thought for
                  a negative thought, you get rid of the negative emotion, whatever it is. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                  &nbspIf you have a major life problem, such as a divorce, a lost job, or a failed investment, the same
                  rule holds true. Stop telling yourself (and anyone who will listen) why you are entitled to be angry
                  or unhappy. Instead, make excuses for the other person each time you think about the situation until
                  the negativity dies away. When the fire of negative emotion goes out, you can then turn your attention
                  to something positive. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOne of the most important rules for success and
                  happiness is, ''Don't be upset or worry about something that you can't do anything about.'' Don't
                  criticize anyone for something that the person cannot change. A famous law says, ''If there is no
                  solution, there is no problem.'' <br><br>
              <li><b>TWO TIME PERIODS</b>
                <p> <br>There are two time periods in life, the past and the future. The present is only a brief,
                  fleeting moment. You can choose to focus your attention on what has happened, which cannot be changed,
                  or on the future, on what is possible, over which you have some control. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                  &nbspMany people spend most of their emotional energies being upset and angry about events that
                  occurred in the past. Unfortunately, this energy is completely wasted. Nothing good can come of
                  constantly complaining about the past. Even worse, the negative emotions kept alive by reliving past
                  events rob you of the joy and excitement that you could experience by thinking about future
                  possibilities. <br><br>
              <li><b>LET IT GO</b>
                <p> <br>A psychiatrist with more than 25 years' experience working with unhappy people wrote that the
                  two most common words he heard in his practice were the words ''if only.'' It seemed that most unhappy
                  people are held back by some event that occurred in the past that they cannot let go of. They are
                  still resentful, angry, or depressed over something that someone did or did not do or say.They are
                  angry with one or both parents, a sibling, a previous relationship or marriage, a boss or business
                  relationship, a failed investment or financial mistake. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe fact is
                  that your life will be a continuous series of problems, difficulties, setbacks, and temporary
                  failures. These unexpected and unwanted reversals and disappointments are a normal, natural, and
                  unavoidable fact of growing up.To change your thinking and change your life, you must make a decision
                  to get over them and to get on with your life, no matter what happened. Until you do, you remain a
                  slave to the past, which cannot be changed in any case. Make a decision today that, from now on, you
                  are going to eliminate all the ''if only's'' from your life. <br><br>
              <li><b>REINTERPRET EVENTS DIFFERENTLY</b>
                <p> <br>The author and speaker Wayne Dyer says, ''It's never too late to have a happy childhood.'' He
                  means that at any time you can reinterpret the unhappy events of your early life in a positive way.You
                  can practice the Law of Substitution and look into those negative experiences for something good, and
                  think about that instead. You can focus on how your unhappy experiences have made you a better, wiser
                  person. You can actually be grateful to people who have hurt you in the past because they have made
                  you so much stronger in the present. And in any case, it could not have happened otherwise.
                  <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYour parents had no experience with raising children. In addition, they
                  were a product of the way they were raised. Like all humans, they came to parenting with their
                  problems and weaknesses, just as you have today. Nonetheless, they did the best they could with what
                  they had. They were the people they were, and they could not have raised you any differently than they
                  did. It is silly to continue to be unhappy about things they did or didn't do that they were incapable
                  of doing otherwise. Let it go and get on with your life. <br><br>
              <li><b>DON'T TAKE IT PERSONALLY</b>
                <p> <br>The second major cause of negative emotions according to Ouspensky, is identification, or
                  attachment. This occurs when you take something personally or you become attached to a person or
                  thing. You see the unhappy outcome of an event or circumstance as a personal affront or attack on you
                  or on something you believe in or hold dearly. You become emotionally involved in a situation and
                  identify so strongly with it that it affects your emotions and your reason in a negative way.
                  <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe great spiritual teachers, such as Buddha and Jesus, have emphasized
                  the importance of separating yourself emotionally from the situation (disidentification), in order to
                  regain your calmness and composure. Psychologist and philosopher William James of Harvard wrote, ''The
                  first step in dealing with any difficulty is to be willing to have it so.'' He encouraged people to
                  say, ''What cannot be cured must be endured.'' In other words, practice detachment from any person or
                  situation that makes you feel angry or upset. Withdraw the emotional energy from it so that you can
                  regain your calmness and composure. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThis approach does not suggest that
                  you passively accept anything that happens to you. Instead, it encourages you to use your willpower to
                  keep your mind and emotions under control.You discipline yourself to stand back mentally and deal with
                  the problem intelligently. You use your mind to see the situation objectively and make better
                  decisions to resolve it. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspNothing and no one can have any control over
                  you unless there is something you still want from them. They must have something that they can still
                  give you or withhold from you. As soon as you detach emotionally from a person or object and no longer
                  want anything from them, you are free. This ability to practice detachment is a power you can develop
                  through practice. It can make you the master of a situation that might otherwise cause you to become
                  upset and angry. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOne of the kindest things you can do to help others is
                  to encourage them to stand back from a problem situation and be objective about it. Encourage them to
                  view the difficulty as if it was happening to someone else. Ask them what advice they would give to
                  another person who was facing this same problem. By detaching from the emotionally charged situation,
                  you and others will become much more capable of dealing with it effectively. <br><br>
              <li><b>THE OPINIONS OF OTHERS</b>
                <p> <br>The third major cause of negative emotions, according to Ouspensky, is <i>inward
                    considering.</i> This occurs when you become overly concerned with the way people are treating you.
                  If you perceive that someone is not giving you the respect that you feel you deserve, you can feel
                  insulted and angry, and want to strike back. If people are rude or indifferent to you, you can
                  experience their behavior as an attack on your personality or character. This interpretation of their
                  attitude or behavior can make you angry or depressed. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspPsychologists say
                  that everything we do is to increase our selfesteem and sense of personal value, or to protect it from
                  being diminished by other people or circumstances. If your self-esteem is not as high as it could be,
                  you will be sensitive to the actions and reactions of other people toward you.You will take everything
                  <i>personally</i>, exactly as if what they said or did was consciously and deliberately directed at
                  you. However, this is seldom the case. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe fact is that most people are
                  preoccupied with themselves and their own problems. As much as 99 percent of the time, people are
                  wrapped up in their own thoughts about themselves. They devote the other 1 percent of emotional energy
                  they have available to everyone else in the world, including you. The person who cuts you off in
                  traffic is so involved with his own thoughts, he is not even aware of your existence. It would be
                  silly to become angry or upset over his thoughtless action. <br><br>
              <li><b>SET YOUR OWN SAILS</b>
                <p> <br>There is a rule that I have learned from experience:<i> Never do or refrain from doing something
                    because you are concerned about what people might think about you. The fact is that nobody is even
                    thinking about you at all.</i> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOf course, I am not talking about
                  criminal or antisocial behaviors. But it is amazing how many people make decisions to get into or to
                  not get into relationships, businesses, new endeavors, adventures, and other things for fear that
                  someone else might not approve. They stay in marriages they hate, they work at jobs they dislike, or
                  they turn down business opportunities for fear that someone, anyone, might criticize them. The truth
                  is that no one cares more about your key life decisions than you do. Plan accordingly. <br><br>&nbsp
                  &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn Abraham Maslow's studies of self-actualizing people, those 1 or 2 percent of men
                  and women who are fully mature, fully functioning adults, he found a particular quality that they all
                  had in common: <i>They were completely honest with themselves.</i> They were objective and clear about
                  their own strengths and weaknesses. They did not hope or pretend that they were other than they were.
                  This self-acceptance was a foundation stone of their self-esteem and self-respect. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                  &nbsp &nbspBecause they knew who they were, and who they were not, they did not feel that they had to
                  continually earn the approval of others. They took the opinions of others into consideration, but then
                  they made their own decisions. They were not overly influenced by the possible approval or disapproval
                  of other people.You should do the same.You are the one who cares the most and who is most affected, in
                  any case. <br><br>
              <li><b>THE RESPECT OF OTHERS</b>
                <p> <br>When Somerset Maugham, the famous English author, was asked by a reporter for his chief
                  motivation for writing, he replied, ''I write to earn the respect of the people I respect.''
                  <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe fact is that much of what you do, or fail to do, is influenced by
                  the same concern.You do many things in your social life to earn the respect of the people you respect,
                  or at least not to lose it. In fact, the people whose respect is most important to you largely
                  determine how good you feel about yourself, both at home and at work. The respect of others has an
                  inordinate influence on your self-esteem because it is so closely linked to your self-ideal and your
                  self-image. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspExceptional men and women look up to and seek the respect
                  of men and women of character and accomplishment. They strive, at an unconscious level, to behave and
                  to live up to their ideals of how an excellent person would behave. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOne
                  of the most important decisions you make as you go through life is to decide for yourself the specific
                  people whose respect is of the greatest value to you. Once you are clear about who you respect and why
                  you respect them, you can then organize your life in such a way that you continually earn that
                  respect, whether they know of your actions or not. <br><br>
              <li><b>THE RESPECT OF OTHERS</b>
                <p> <br>In the famous book In His Steps, by Charles M. Sheldon (Christian Library, 1984), an entire town
                  agrees, prior to every act or decision, to ask the question, ''What would Jesus do?'' and then to
                  behave accordingly. The eventual outcome for the townspeople was that the problems that had divided
                  them were soon solved and the town became happy and prosperous. They created an ideal for themselves
                  and then built their lives around living up to it. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn a study of
                  successful men and women, most of whom had started from humble beginnings, researchers found that
                  these people had almost all been avid readers of biographies and autobiographies when they were young.
                  As they read the life stories of famous men and women, they imagined themselves having the same
                  qualities and characters of the people they were studying. When they became adults themselves, those
                  qualities and virtues had become part of their thinking and guided their choices and decisions in
                  later life. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp<i>Modeling</i> has been used as a powerful way to develop
                  personality and character throughout history.Young people have been encouraged to study school heroes
                  and heroines, and emulate them as much as possible. In the military, the heroic acts of soldiers and
                  sailors from the past are taught as part of the curriculum, encouraging young soldiers and sailors to
                  think and act like them when the situation demands it. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The people you
                  most admire and look up to have an inordinate influence on how you think and feel about yourself, and
                  the kind of decisions you make.Who are your role models? <br><br>
              <li><b>CHOOSE YOUR ROLE MODELS WITH CARE</b>
                <p> <br>There is nothing wrong with being thoughtful and concerned about the feelings and reactions of
                  others toward you and your choices. When you select admirable people to look up to, you develop an
                  inner guide that leads you to conduct yourself in an excellent way yourself. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                  &nbspWhat is silly and self-defeating however, is for you to allow yourself to be inordinately
                  influenced by the fleeting opinions of people whose regard and respect is of no concern or value to
                  you. If you have been raised with destructive criticism, you can easily slip into the trap of
                  organizing your life around trying to gain the approval, or escape the disapproval, or people you
                  don't even know or care about. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspHere is the way to avoid this form of
                  negative emotion: Decide for yourself the men and women you most admire, and the qualities they have
                  that you would most like to emulate. From now on, when you have to make a decision, think about
                  someone you admire and ask, ''What would he or she do in this situation?'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                  &nbspWhen you ask this question, you actually connect at an unconscious level with a higher power that
                  will then give you guidance and insight. You will experience a deep inner knowing of exactly the right
                  thing to do or say. You will make the right decision and achieve the desired result. This is a
                  technique used by many successful men and women. Give it a try and see what happens. <br><br>
              <li><b>THE WORST NEGATIVE INFLUENCE OF ALL </b>
                <p> <br>The fourth major cause of negative emotions, according to Ouspensky, and the trigger of anger,
                  resentment, envy, jealousy, and frustration of any kind is blame. It is blame especially that
                  generates anger, the worst of all the negative emotions. Anger is more destructive than any force in
                  the human world. Uncontrolled anger destroys health, relationships, families, businesses, and
                  societies, and is the chief generator of wars, revolutions, and social conflict. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                  &nbsp &nbspThe primary cause of anger can be traced back to destructive criticism in early childhood.
                  Whenever a person is criticized, he reacts exactly as if he is being attacked, with defensiveness and
                  resentment. Since any behavior that you repeat over and over becomes a habit, many people develop the
                  habit of responding with anger to every problem, disappointment, or frustration they experience.
                  Eventually, they reach the point where they are always angry about something. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                  &nbsp &nbspTo become angry, a person must be able to blame someone for something that has happened or
                  not happened that they don't like or approve of. Many people are so preoccupied with blaming others
                  for their problems that they lose contact with reality. They see the entire world through a lens of
                  blame and its sister emotion, guilt. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhenever there is a problem,
                  personal or public, the angry person automatically concludes that someone must be to blame. The
                  individual then spends his time and emotion apportioning blame among various parties. This obsession
                  with blame and anger, leading to resentment and envy, can often consume the person who experiences it.
                  <br><br>
              <li><b>NO ONE IS GUILTY</b>
                <p> <br>Here is a common example.Two people in love get married. Both of them have the best of
                  intentions and the highest of expectations for the future, or they wouldn't get married in the first
                  place. Unfortunately, people and situations change over time. The couple finds that they are no longer
                  happy together and decide to divorce. But then the problems really begin. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                  &nbspInstead of agreeing, like adults, that they have reached a point where they are incompatible and
                  they no longer want to live together, blame must be apportioned. Someone must be guilty. The guilty
                  party must be punished. Lawyers and judges now have to get involved. Detectives and accountants are
                  hired to dig up dirt on each party. The situation gets worse and worse, until it finally ends in
                  anger, bitterness, accusations, and even hatred. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe best of solutions,
                  when a marriage or a relationship does not work out, is to accept that fact as an unfortunate reality,
                  make reasonable provisions for each party, and then for each person to get on with his or her life.
                  Many couples are doing this today through mediation rather than going through the bitterness of a
                  traditional divorce. The results turn out to be better for everyone involved. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                  &nbsp &nbspIt is a psychological fact that most people feel that they are right in whatever they do.
                  But as soon as one person starts to blame the other, and even worse, demand that the other person
                  admit to being guilty, the emotional and legal battles begin. The saddest part of these legal battles
                  is that they usually end where they started, with no one having gained very much. <br><br>
              <li><b>ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY</b>
                <p> <br>The best way to eliminate anger of all kinds is to accept responsibility. The acceptance of
                  responsibility immediately short-circuits the emotion of anger. All the energy that anger requires for
                  its existence is cut off. As soon as you say, <i>''I am responsible!''</i> your anger stops. Because
                  of the Law of Substitution and the fact that your mind can hold only one thought at a time, you cannot
                  accept responsibility for your situation and be angry at the same time.The idea of blame, on which the
                  emotion of anger is based, is canceled out by the decision to accept responsibility. <br><br>
              <li><b>POSITIVE VERSUS NEGATIVE WORLDVIEWS</b>
                <p> <br>There are two basic ways of looking at your world.You can have a positive and <i>benevolent</i>
                  worldview or a negative and <i>malevolent</i> worldview. By taking responsibility for yourself and
                  what happens to you, you become positive. You see the world in benevolent terms.You become more
                  optimistic toward yourself and your possibilities. You become a happier and more effective person.
                  <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn contrast, when you take a negative or malevolent worldview, you see
                  problems and injustice everywhere.You see oppression and evil. You see guilty people all around you.
                  You see limitations and unfairness rather than opportunity and hope. Worst of all, you spend your time
                  apportioning blame to various people and institutions for all the problems you see. <br><br>
              <li><b>DIFFERENCES IN RESULTS</b>
                <p> <br>For example, in this country, some people are better off than others. This has been true of all
                  societies throughout human history. This can be for various reasons. It may be the result of different
                  people having different talents, ambitions, and desires. It may be the result of some people working
                  harder, having a better start at life, being born with greater intelligence, or simply being at the
                  right place at the right time to catch a favorable trend in the economy. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                  &nbspIn any case, people who are well off are not to blame for the fat that other people are not well
                  off. People who are healthy are not to blame for the fact that other people are sick. People who are
                  successful and happy are not to blame for those who are unsuccessful and unhappy. People who are
                  building a good life for themselves and their families are not at fault because other people are not.
                  <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspSuccess does not cause failure. <i>Correlation is not causation.</i>
                  Because both situations occur simultaneously, this does not mean that one caused the other. An honest
                  acceptance of this simple fact would solve many arguments and disagreements at the philosophical and
                  political levels. <br><br>
              <li><b>THE POWER OF FORGIVENESS</b>
                <p> <br>The root cause of negative emotions, the main factor that predisposes a person to blaming and to
                  anger and resentment, fear and doubt, envy and jealousy, is the <i>inability to forgive</i> someone we
                  feel has hurt us in some way. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAs we develop as children, we go through
                  a phase where ''justice'' is very important to us.We fixate on the concept of ''fairness.'' We are
                  upset by any situation in our lives that does not seem to be fair and equitable to anyone, especially
                  if it concerns ourselves. Whenever we feel that we or anyone else has been unfairly treated, for any
                  reason, we take it as a personal attack. Our fragile selfesteem is threatened.We react with anger and
                  resentment. This is a normal developmental phase of growth that we go through as we move toward
                  adulthood. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspHowever, some people fixate at this stage and never grow
                  beyond it. If we are not taught the importance of letting go of our grievances as children, we will
                  come into adulthood with a gunnysack of unforgiven experiences. If we are not careful, we will then
                  build our lives around our anger toward people who we feel are to blame for something they did or that
                  we disapprove of. Many psychotherapists and psychiatrists spend their entire careers helping people
                  confront and deal with these unhappy past and current experiences. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe
                  most powerful and liberating decision you can make is to forgive everyone who has ever hurt you in any
                  way. Only by freeing the other person, in your mind, by forgiving him or her can you be free yourself.
                  This is why most religions stress the importance of forgiveness as the first step toward peace of mind
                  and earthly bliss. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspJust imagine how you would feel if you had no anger
                  toward anyone at all in the whole world. Imagine being a completely positive, optimistic, cheerful
                  person, with high levels of self-esteem and enthusiasm and unlimited self-confidence. Imagine being a
                  warm, friendly, loving person filled with feelings of calmness and inner peace. All this is possible
                  for you when you practice forgiveness. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn contrast, the refusal or
                  failure to forgive lies at the base of negativity, anger, stress, anxiety, mental and physical
                  illness, and most unhappiness. The refusal to forgive keeps you trapped. Forgiveness sets you free.
                  And it is always a choice you make. It has nothing to do with the other person or situation. <br><br>
              <li><b>IT TAKES TWO</b>
                <p> <br>Some people hold themselves back from forgiving with a false basic premise.They think that by
                  forgiving they are condoning the behavior of the person they are mad at.They think that, if they
                  forgive the other person, they are doing that person a favor. They even think that they are letting
                  the other person go free, which they are determined not to do. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe fact
                  is that it takes two to make a prison, the prisoner and the jailer. Both are in the jail. When you let
                  the other person go free, you liberate yourself.You don't have to condone the behavior or like the
                  person who hurt you.You just have to forgive him or her so that you can get on with the rest of your
                  life. Forgiveness is therefore a totally selfish act. It really has nothing to do with the other
                  person at all. It has only to do with your own mental integrity and peace of mind. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                  &nbsp &nbspThe comedian Buddy Hackett once said, ''I never hold grudges; while you're holding grudges,
                  they're out dancing!'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen you remain angry with another person, you
                  give away your emotional control to that person each time you think of him or her.You allow him or her
                  to control your emotions at long distance. By not forgiving, you allow that person to run your
                  emotional life, exactly as if he or she were right there with you and the situation was occurring all
                  over again. <br><br>
              <li><b>THE PATH TO FORGIVENESS</b>
                <p> <br>The way you forgive is simple. Each time you think of the other person, you use the Law of
                  Substitution and say, <i>''God bless him/her; I forgive him/her for everything, and I wish him/her
                    well.''</i> It is not possible to bless and forgive another person and simultaneously be angry or
                  upset. The positive thought cancels out the negative thought. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYou can
                  speed up the process of personal liberation by accepting responsibility for your share of what
                  happened. Very few negative events that lead to anger and resentment occur in a vacuum. Almost
                  invariably, you did something to contribute to the situation. You therefore need to have the maturity
                  to take your share of the responsibility. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYou can then say, <i>''I am
                    responsible. I shouldn't have gotten into the situation in the first place, or stayed in so long. I
                    should not have done what I did. I forgive him/her completely and let it go.''</i> <br><br>&nbsp
                  &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIt may be difficult for you to forgive at first.These words will be hard for you.
                  Many people have built their entire adult lives around their grievances. They are afraid that they
                  will have nothing else to talk about if they stop complaining about their parents or their bad
                  marriages. But don't worry. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen you forgive others and let them go,
                  you soon begin to feel lighter and happier. As the thoughts of anger and resentment fade away, your
                  mind will fill with positive thoughts.You will have more energy and enthusiasm. You will feel stronger
                  and more confident.Your whole future will open up before you, like a summer sunrise. <br><br>&nbsp
                  &nbsp &nbsp &nbspDon't worry about what your friends think or say when you decide to forgive people
                  who have hurt you.They are probably tired of hearing your complaints about the unfortunate events of
                  your past. In fact, when you start forgiving, you will often find that the only common bond between
                  you and certain people is your gripe sessions. When you decide to forgive others, you may no longer
                  find them very interesting to talk to. <br><br>
              <li><b>THE PEOPLE YOU MUST FORGIVE</b>
                <p> <br>There are four groups people you need to forgive if you are serious about changing your thinking
                  and changing your life. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe first is your parents, living or dead.You
                  must absolutely forgive them for every mistake they ever made in bringing you up. At the very least,
                  you should be grateful to them for giving you life. They got you here. If you are happy to be alive,
                  you can forgive them for everything else. Never complain about them again. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                  &nbspMany of my seminar participants have phoned or visited their parents and told them that they
                  forgive them for everything. Often this simple act of courage and character has had a profound effect
                  on their relationship with their mother or father. From that day onward, they have become good
                  friends, which lasted the rest of their lives together. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn contrast, by
                  not forgiving your parents, you remain forever a child.You block your own chance to grow up and become
                  a fully functioning adult. You continue to see yourself as a victim. Even worse, you keep your
                  negative feelings of inferiority and anger alive.If your parents die without your having forgiven
                  them, it can bother you for the rest of your life. <br><br>
              <li><b>CLOSE PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS</b>
                <p> <br>The second group you must forgive is the people from your <i>close relationships</i> that didn't
                  work out. Marriage and other intimate relationships can be so intense, and so threatening to your
                  feelings of self-esteem and self-worth, that you can be angry and unforgiving toward those people for
                  years. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspBut you were at least partially responsible. Have the personal
                  strength and integrity to say, ''I am responsible,'' and then forgive the other person and let him or
                  her go. Say the words, ''I forgive him/her for everything and I wish him/her well.'' Each time you
                  repeat this, the negative emotion attached to the memory will diminish. Soon it will be gone forever.
                  <br><br>
              <li><b>THE LETTER</b>
                <p> <br>Many of my graduates have found that ''the letter'' is the key to putting a bad relationship
                  behind them forever. This is a powerful technique that can free you from feelings of anger and
                  resentment almost instantly. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspHere is how it works:You to sit down and
                  write the other person a letter of forgiveness. It consists of three parts. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                  &nbspFirst you say, ''I forgive you for everything you ever did that hurt me.'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                  &nbsp &nbspSecond, you write out a description or list of every single thing that you are still angry
                  about. Some people write several pages in this part. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThird, you end the
                  letter with the words, ''I wish you well.'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYou then take the letter to
                  the mailbox and drop it in. At that moment, you will feel a huge sense of relief, and you will be free
                  at last. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspBy the way, don't worry about how the other person might
                  react. That is not your concern.Your goal is to free yourself, to regain your peace of mind, and to
                  get on with the wonderful life that lies ahead of you. <br><br>
              <li><b>CLEAR YOUR SLATE</b>
                <p> <br>The third group you must forgive is everyone else in your life who has ever hurt you in any way.
                  Let them go. Forgive every boss, business partner, friend, crook, or betrayer who has ever caused you
                  grief of any kind. Clean the slate. Wipe each of their names and images off by saying, ''I forgive
                  him/her for everything, and I wish him/her well.'' Repeat this statement each time you think of the
                  person or situation until the negative feelings are gone. <br>
              <li><b>SET YOURSELF FREE</b>
                <p> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe fourth and final person you have to forgive is yourself.You must
                  absolutely forgive yourself for every silly, senseless, wicked, brainless, thoughtless, or cruel thing
                  you have ever done or said. Stop carrying these past mistakes around with you. That was then and this
                  is now. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThink of it this way:When you did those things in the past that
                  you still feel badly about, you were not the person you are today. At that time, you were a different
                  person, younger and less experienced. You were not your true self.You were an immature version of the
                  person you have become with experience. Stop beating yourself up for something that occurred in the
                  past that you cannot change. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn psychotherapy, when a person feels
                  burdened with a deep sense of guilt or shame as the result of a childhood trauma, the cathartic moment
                  comes when he or she suddenly realizes, ''It's not my fault.'' Sometimes you did things, or things
                  were done to you, when you were too young or inexperienced to know what was going on or to change the
                  situation. It was not your fault.You did the best you could.You are okay. Forgive yourself and let
                  yourself off the hook. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspJust say, <i>''I forgive myself for every
                    mistake I ever made. I am a thoroughly good person and I am going to have a wonderful future.''</i>
                  Whenever you think of that event or situation, just repeat, ''I forgive myself completely.'' And then
                  get on with your life. Focus on the future rather than the past. Look at where you are going rather
                  than where you have been. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspFinally, if you did something that hurt
                  someone, and you still feel badly about it, you can go to that person, or write, and apologize. Tell
                  the person you are sorry for what you did or said. Whatever his or her reaction, positive or negative,
                  it doesn't matter. The very act of repentance, of expressing regret, will set you free. <br><br>
              <li><b>A FINAL WARNING</b>
                <p> <br>Most people are open to the idea of forgiveness. It is among the core beliefs of most religions,
                  and is taught in psychology and metaphysics. You are probably comfortable with the idea of forgiving
                  most of the people in your life who have hurt you in some way. But there is a great danger.
                  <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe danger is that <i>your refusal to forgive just one major grievance
                    can be enough to sabotage your entire life.</i> Your insistence on holding onto just one person or
                  situation by not forgiving can put the brakes on all your forward progress. There are countless men
                  and women who ruin their lives because of their anger and resentment toward a single person.They can't
                  let go of it, and so they never get free. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspDon't let this happen to
                  you.You must have the courage and character to forgive everyone, without exception. There should be no
                  one in your life with whom you are still angry. Your mind should be calm and clear.You should be able
                  to say, <i>''I do not have a negative or unforgiving thought toward anyone in the world; I freely
                    forgive them all.''</i> <br><br>
              <li><b>TAKE CONTROL OVER YOUR EMOTIONS</b>
                <p> <br>The starting point of eliminating negative emotions is for you to take full control over your
                  thoughts and actions, and to discipline yourself not to express negative emotions when they arise, as
                  they surely will.You may not be able to stop the initial negative reaction to a disappointment or a
                  frustrated expectation, but you can refuse to express it, either to yourself or to another.You can
                  cancel it instantly by saying, <i>''I am responsible!''</i> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThere are
                  some who say that it is healthy to express the negative emotions of anger, hurt, fear, and doubt. But
                  the fact is that <i>whatever you dwell upon and talk about grows in your reality.</i> A small negative
                  experience is like a spark that can be fanned into a blaze by thinking and talking about it. Instead,
                  snuff it out the instant it arises by saying, ''I am responsible!''Then look for reasons why you might
                  be responsible.You will always find them. <br><br>
              <li><b>THE TRUE GODS ARRIVE</b>
                <p> <br>An English poet once wrote, ''When the false gods go, the true gods arrive.'' When you stop
                  thinking about, talking about, and rehearsing negative events and the emotions they trigger, the
                  ''true gods'' of positive emotions will fill your mind and heart. When you let go of the thoughts,
                  opinions, prejudices, and attitudes that make you unhappy, you will begin to experience the thoughts
                  and emotions that make you feel good about yourself and your life. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                  &nbspNature is on your side. Nature wants you to be happy, healthy, prosperous, and fulfilled.Your
                  destiny is to experience joy, harmony, love, and the greatest of all human blessings, <i>peace of
                    mind.</i> And just as a gyroscope knocked off balance returns to an upright position, your life and
                  emotions return to peace and joy just as soon as you stop doing and saying the things that move you
                  away from a sense of inner peace. Decide this <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspDecide this very day to
                  give up your negative emotions. Resolve from this moment forward to become a positive, optimistic,
                  happy, enthusiastic person in every part of your life. Change your thinking about yourself and your
                  possibilities, and you change your life. <br><br><b>ACTION EXERCISES</b>
                <ol> <br><br>
                  <li>
                    Resolve today that you are going to be a completely happy person. Now ask, ''What is it in my life
                    that makes me unhappy or causes me stress?''Whatever your answer, decide to deal with it and
                    eliminate it. <br><br>
                  <li>Recall an experience from your childhood that you are still angry about. Now reinterpret that
                    experience positively and view it as a valuable learning experience. <br><br>
                  <li>In what areas of your life are you angry or resentful because you are still blaming someone for
                    something he did or didn't do? Whatever it is, accept responsibility and get on with your life.
                    <br><br>
                  <li>Who is there in your past that you have not forgiven? What previous experience causes you the most
                    anger still today? Whoever or whatever it is, resolve to forgive and let it go. <br><br>
                  <li>Don't take things personally anymore. From now on, when people do not respect you or treat you as
                    you wish to be treated, rise above it and go about your business. <br><br>
                  <li>Make a decision today to forgive everyone in your past toward whom you still feel any negative
                    emotion. Let them go and let yourself go at the same time. <br><br>
                  <li>Forgive yourself for every mistake you have ever made. If it is appropriate, go and ask
                    forgiveness of the other person. Set yourself free.

              <li><b>A JOURNEY THROUGH ITALY</b>
                <p> <br>Let me tell you a story. Some years ago, I took my family to Italy on vacation.We toured several
                  of the
                  great art museums of Rome and Florence. In Florence, there is a special museum that was built to house
                  the
                  statue of David created by Michelangelo several hundred years ago. This is perhaps the most beautiful
                  piece of
                  sculpture in the world.The actual physical experience of being in the same room with it is something
                  that none
                  of us has ever forgotten. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe story of the creation of the <i>David</i>
                  is very
                  interesting and contains a lesson for all of us. Michelangelo was commissioned by the Medicis to
                  create a
                  statue for the main square in Florence. The Medicis were the wealthiest and most powerful family of
                  Italy at
                  the time. A commission for a statue from the Medicis was not only a great honor; it was also a task
                  that could
                  not be refused. For two years, Michelangelo searched for a block of stone out of which he could create
                  the
                  kind of masterpiece the Medicis were looking for. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspFinally, on a side
                  street of
                  Florence, partially overgrown with weeds and covered with dirt, he found a huge slab of marble lying
                  on wooden
                  trestles. It had been hauled down from the mountains years before and had never been used.
                  <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                  &nbsp &nbspMichelangelo had walked past this street many times, but this time he stopped and looked
                  more
                  closely. As he walked back and forth studying the block of marble, he actually envisioned the statue
                  of David
                  and saw it in its entirety. <br><br>
              <li><b>GREAT SUCCESS REQUIRES LONG, HARD WORK</b>
                <p> <br>The sculptor quickly arranged to have workmen haul the block of marble to his studio some
                  distance away.
                  He then began the long, hard job of hammering and chiseling. It took him two solid years of work to
                  create the
                  rough outline of the statue. He then put his hammers and chisels aside and spent two more years
                  polishing and
                  sanding before the statue was complete. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspMichelangelo was already famous
                  as a
                  sculptor, and the news that he was working on a major commission for the Medicis spread all over
                  Italy. When
                  the day came for its first public viewing, thousands of people came from all over Italy and gathered
                  in the
                  main square.When it was unveiled, the crowd stood gaping in awe. It was breathtakingly beautiful.
                  People
                  cheered.Women fainted. The audience was amazed at the incredible beauty of the enormous statue.
                  Michelangelo
                  was immediately recognized as the greatest sculptor of his age. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                  &nbspAfterward, when
                  Michelangelo was asked how he was able to create such a masterpiece, he replied by saying that he saw
                  the
                  David complete and perfect in the marble. All he did was to remove everything that was not the David.
                  <br><br>
              <li><b>YOU ARE A MASTERPIECE</b>
                <p> <br>There are many parallels between yourself and the David.You are very much like a great
                  masterpiece
                  enclosed in marble as well. But the marble that envelops you, and most other people, is the marble of
                  small,
                  limited thinking and excessive worry about the possibilities of loss or failure, rather than an
                  excited
                  anticipation of the rewards of success and achievement. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspTo realize your
                  full
                  potential, your greatest need is to break out of your limited thinking by dreaming big dreams and
                  imagining
                  unlimited possibilities.You need to remove all the negative beliefs that hold you back from becoming
                  all you
                  are capable of becoming. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspBut remember, even after the David had been
                  released
                  from the marble, it took Michelangelo two solid years of sanding and polishing to turn it into a
                  masterpiece.
                  In the same way, you also have to work on yourself, sanding and polishing, learning and practicing,
                  for days,
                  weeks, months, and even years, to develop and bring out all the talents and abilities that lie deep
                  inside of
                  you. <br><br>
              <li><b>YOU CAN BECOME UNSTOPPABLE</b>
                <p> <br>The central purpose of this book is to help you change your thinking in such a way that you
                  become
                  absolutely <i>unstoppable</i> in achieving any goal you can set for yourself.Your goal is to develop
                  yourself
                  to the point <i>psychologically</i> where you become like an irresistible force of nature.You will be
                  like the
                  tide coming in, or like a powerful storm that sweeps across the land. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                  &nbspYour aim
                  is to become so confident, courageous, strong, and resolute that you can set any goal for yourself
                  with the
                  firm knowledge that you can learn what you need to learn, and do what you need to do, to eventually
                  achieve
                  it.You will become so persistent and determined that nothing and no one can slow you down or alter
                  your
                  course.You will become truly unstoppable! <br><br>
              <li><b>DREAM BIG DREAMS</b>
                <p> <br>You begin the process of becoming unstoppable by dreaming big dreams. Since everything you
                  create in
                  your world begins with a thought, the bigger the dreams you dream, the bigger the goals you will
                  achieve. All
                  successful men and women are dreamers. All peak performers are what are called ''blue-sky thinkers.''
                  They
                  continually allow their minds to float freely when they think about what is possible for them. They
                  look at
                  the unlimited blue sky above them as the only limit to everything and anything that they could
                  possibly be, or
                  have or do. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspSuccessful people continually practice ''back from the
                  future''
                  thinking. They project into the future several years and imagine what their lives would look like if
                  they had
                  achieved all of their goals. They look back to the present, from the mental vantage point of the
                  future, like
                  looking from the top of a high mountain down to where they are actually standing in the valley, in the
                  present. They then look at the path that they would have to take to get to where they want to be in
                  the
                  future. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspBy the law of correspondence, whatever you can clearly see on
                  the
                  inside, you will eventually experience on the outside.You should therefore visualize your goals with
                  as much
                  clarity and vividness as possible. Visualize your goals <i>intensely</i> and create within yourself
                  the same
                  feeling that you would have if you had already achieved your goals. <i>Visualize</i> your goals
                  frequently.
                  Replay a picture of your goal, as if you had already realized it, on the screen of your mind as many
                  times a
                  day as you possibly can. Visualize your goals for as long as you possibly can, preferably just before
                  falling
                  asleep each night. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspRepeat these exercises of visualization-vividness,
                  intensity, frequency, and duration-until your goals become absolutely clear, living, breathing,
                  exciting,
                  clear pictures in your mind. The more skilled you become at moving from the dream through the goal to
                  the
                  visualization, the more motivated and determined you will be. The more clarity you develop, the more
                  courage
                  and confidence you will have, and the more unstoppable you will become. <br>
              <li><b>CREATE YOUR IDEAL FUTURE VISION</b>
                <p> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe most important part of dreaming big dreams is for you to define
                  your
                  ideal <i>future vision.</i> It is for you to think about what you <i>want</i> before you begin to
                  think about
                  what is <i>possible</i> for you.You dream big dreams by looking into the future and imagining that you
                  have no
                  limitations holding you back from achieving anything you set your mind on. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                  &nbspDetach yourself from your current situation and allow yourself to dream. Pretend for the moment
                  that you
                  have all the time and money you need. Imagine that you have all the connections and contacts, all the
                  resources and opportunities, all the education and knowledge, all the skills and experience that you
                  require
                  to be, have, or do anything that you could dream of. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspImagine your ideal
                  lifestyle. Imagine your ideal job or income. Imagine where you would like to live and how you would
                  like to
                  spend each day, each week, each month. Imagine your ideal family life. Imagine your ideal state of
                  health.
                  Design your perfect life in every respect. <br><br>
              <li><b>MAKE YOUR OWN DREAM LIST</b>
                <p> <br>Here is an exercise for you.Take out a piece of paper and at the top write the words ''Dream
                  List.''
                  Underline these words and then write down everything that you can think of that you could ever
                  possibly want
                  if you had no limitations whatsoever. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspMost people are held back by
                  their
                  self-limiting beliefs.The way you burst these mental chains is with a dream list.The very fact that
                  you can
                  write down something that you would love to have someday means that you probably have within you,
                  right now,
                  the ability to achieve it. Let your mind float freely as you write. There will be lots of time to
                  organize and
                  evaluate your dreams later. <br><br>
              <li><b>WHAT WOULD YOU DARE TO DREAM?</b>
                <p> <br>Here is a great question: ''What one great thing would you dare to dream if you knew you could
                  not
                  fail?'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIf you were absolutely guaranteed of success in the achievement
                  of any
                  one goal, big or small, long-term or short-term, what would it be? If a billionaire took a liking to
                  you and
                  offered to write you a check to cover any goal that you could clearly define, what one goal would you
                  choose?
                  <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIf you could have any job, what would it be? If you could work for any
                  kind of
                  company, what kind of a company would you select? Where would it be, and what would it be doing? If
                  your
                  family life and your relationships could be perfect in every respect, what would they look like?
                  Answer these
                  questions clearly. Write them down. <br><br>
              <li><b>START WORK ON YOUR FUTURE</b>
                <p> <br>You begin the creation of your ideal future by making up your dream list.You write down
                  everything that
                  you would want to be, do and have, exactly as if you had no limitations at all.You make up your list
                  as if you
                  were absolutely guaranteed of success. Then you can begin refining your list, step by step to develop
                  a
                  detailed blueprint for your life. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspHenry David Thoreau once wrote,
                  <i>''Have you
                    built your castles in the air? Good, that's where they should be built. Now, go to work and build
                    foundations under them.''</i> Once you have broken free from your limited thinking, like a balloon
                  casting
                  loose its moorings and rising high into the sky, you can begin to turn your dreams and fantasies into
                  concrete
                  practical goals with specific plans of action. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYour ability to set
                  goals and to
                  make plans for their accomplishment is the ''master skill'' of success.With this master skill, there
                  are no
                  limits on what you can accomplish. Putting your goals on paper is the next step in the process.
                  <br><br>
              <li><b>HOW TO ACHIEVE ANY GOAL</b>
                <p> <br>There is a seven-step method for goal setting and achievement that you can use, over and over,
                  in any
                  situation, to accomplish anything you could ever want for yourself. These seven steps constitute a
                  powerful,
                  proven formula that you can use to change your life immediately. <br><br>
              <li><b>STEP ONE: DECIDE EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT</b>
                <p> <br>A real goal is clear, specific, measurable, and time bounded. A nongoal- a wish or a hope-is
                  fuzzy and
                  unclear. It is a fantasy that floats in the air. People with clear, specific goals, who know exactly
                  what they
                  want, are very different from people who are going through life hoping for the best.Your ability to
                  decide
                  exactly what it is you want in each area of your life is one of the most important responsibilities of
                  adult
                  life. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspPeople often approach me at my seminars and ask what their goals
                  should
                  be. I reply that only they can decide. It is amazing how many of them tell me how hard it is to set
                  goals, and
                  I agree with them. It is hard, but it is also essential. With clear goals, you can do almost anything.
                  Without
                  them, you can do virtually nothing. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOne of the major reasons that
                  people fail
                  in life is because they waste so much of their time doing things of low value or no value at all. And
                  the
                  reason they waste so much time is because they have no real idea of what they really want. Once you
                  have clear
                  goals, your ability to manage your time improves dramatically. <br><br>
              <li><b>USE YOUR TIME WELL</b>
                <p> <br>Here is a way to decide whether something is a good use of your time. Just ask, <i>''Does this
                    move me
                    toward the achievement of one of my goals?''</i> If the activity helps you to achieve a goal you
                  have set
                  for yourself, it is a good use of time. If it doesn't, it is a poor use of time. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                  &nbsp
                  &nbspWhen you get into the habit of only doing those things that move you toward your goals, your life
                  will
                  take off.Your results will improve.You will soon find yourself busy every hour of every day doing
                  things that
                  are helping you in some way.You will have no time left to spend on activities that aren't helping you
                  to
                  achieve one of your goals. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen you set clear goals for yourself, and
                  you know
                  exactly what you want, you will become increasingly impatient with activities that are not helping you
                  in some
                  way.You will watch less television. You will listen to less radio. You will read the newspapers
                  quickly, if at
                  all. You will become far more selective with your friends and your social activities.You will spend
                  time only
                  with people you enjoy, people you can learn and benefit from. But, as the old saying goes, <i>''If you
                    don't
                    know where you're going, any road will take you there.''</i> <br>
              <li><b>STEP TWO: WRITE DOWN YOUR GOALS</b>
                <p> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWrite your goals down on paper. There is something quite incredible
                  that
                  happens between the brain and the hand. When you take a paper and pen and write down your goals, you
                  activate
                  the Laws of Expectation, Attraction, and Correspondence simultaneously. You intensify your belief and
                  deepen
                  your conviction that your goals are possible for you. The very act of writing down your goals gives
                  you a
                  sense of control and personal power.Written goals increase your resolve and determination to do
                  whatever is
                  necessary to achieve them. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe speed at which you will begin to achieve
                  your
                  goals after you have written them down is nothing short of miraculous. The very act of writing out
                  your goals
                  increases the likelihood of your achieving them by as much as 10 times-1,000 percent! <br><br>&nbsp
                  &nbsp
                  &nbsp &nbspMany thousands of my graduates have written or come back to tell me about the amazing
                  things that
                  have happened in their lives that started immediately after they began putting their goals in writing.
                  <br><br>
              <li><b>STEP THREE: BE WILLING TO PAY THE PRICE</b>
                <p> <br>Determine the price you are going to have to pay to achieve your goal. Make a list of everything
                  that
                  you are going to have to do if you want to make your goal a reality. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                  &nbspAre you
                  going to have to start each day's work a little earlier, work a little harder, and stay a little
                  later? Write
                  it down. Are you going to have to upgrade your knowledge and skills, and take additional courses?
                  Again, write
                  it down. Are you going to have to change jobs, change industries, or change careers in order to
                  achieve
                  everything that is possible for you? Write it down. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe Law of Cause
                  and Effect
                  is the iron law of the universe. For everything that you want, there is a price that must be paid.
                  This price
                  must be paid <i>in full</i> and <i>in advance</i>. The Law of Sowing and Reaping is not the Law of
                  Reaping and
                  Sowing.You have to put in before you <i>get out.</i>You have to <i>give</i> before you
                  <i>receive</i>.You have
                  to pay the price before you enjoy the reward. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYour willingness to do
                  whatever
                  you need to do, pay whatever price is required, go whatever distance is necessary, and make whatever
                  sacrifice
                  is demanded is the measure of how badly you really want your goal. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspMany
                  people
                  sabotage their own success by deciding that they want a particular goal, and although they are willing
                  to pay
                  a high price for it, they are not quite willing to pay the full price that the goal demands. This is
                  like
                  wanting to win in a poker game but not being willing to match the final bet made by the other
                  player.You end
                  up losing the whole hand, just as by failing to make a total commitment people end up losing the
                  entire goal.
                  <br><br>
              <li><b>STEP FOUR: MAKE A DETAILED PLAN</b>
                <p> <br>Make a plan, in writing. Remember, the ability to develop written goals and create plans for
                  their
                  achievement is the master skill of success. A plan begins with your making a list of all the things
                  that you
                  can think of that you are going to have to do to achieve your goal. Once you have made your list, you
                  can add
                  new items as they occur to you. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYou then organize your list in terms of
                  priority and sequence. What are the <i>most important </i>things on the list that you will have to do
                  to
                  achieve your goal? What are the things that you will have to do <i>before</i> you do something else?
                  Which
                  items on your list are dependent on your completing other items <i>first?</i> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                  &nbsp &nbspA
                  plan of action gives you a track to run on. It increases your level of belief and intensifies your
                  desire for
                  the goal.You gradually become convinced that your goal is actually possible and achievable for you.You
                  begin
                  to see possibilities that you may not even have been aware of in the absence of a written plan.
                  <br><br>
              <li><b>STEP FIVE: TAKE ACTION ON YOUR PLAN</b>
                <p> <br>Take action of some kind in the direction of your goal. Once you have set a goal, written it
                  down,
                  determined the price that you are going to have to pay, and made a plan, you must take some action
                  immediately. Even if you only make one phone call or collect one piece of information, be sure to do
                  something. In the Bible it says, <i>''Faith without deeds is dead.''</i> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                  &nbspThere
                  is something powerful in your willingness to take a specific action, in faith, in the direction of
                  your goal,
                  with no guarantee of success.Your action itself seems to trigger all kinds of other powers and forces
                  in the
                  universe.You activate the Law of Attraction to help you.When you take action, you demonstrate to
                  yourself, and
                  to others for that matter, that you are really serious about your goal. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                  &nbspUntil
                  you have taken a specific, irrevocable action of some kind, you have merely engaged in an enjoyable
                  exercise,
                  like daydreaming. You have put your key into the ignition but you haven't turned it on. <br><br>
              <li><b>STEP SIX: DO SOMETHING EVERY DAY</b>
                <p> <br>Do something every day that moves you toward your most important goal. This is a vital success
                  principle
                  that generates energy and enthusiasm. For you to maintain your courage, confidence, and
                  selfmotivation, you
                  must be doing something every single day that gives you a feeling of forward motion and progress.Your
                  job is
                  to build yourself up to the point where you genuinely feel unstoppable, and the only way that you can
                  do this
                  is by refusing to stop, by doing something daily. <br><br>
              <li><b>STEP SEVEN: NEVER GIVE UP</b>
                <p> <br>Resolve in advance that you will never quit once you have started toward your goal. No matter
                  how many
                  setbacks or obstacles you experience, make the decision that you will keep on picking yourself up and
                  persisting until you eventually succeed. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspBy deciding in advance that
                  you will
                  persist, no matter what the difficulty, you give yourself a psychological edge. When the difficulties
                  do
                  arise, you will be mentally prepared to plow through them rather than quitting.Your willingness and
                  ability to
                  persist are what will eventually guarantee your success. <br><br>
              <li><b>SECRETS OF SELF-MADE MILLIONAIRES</b>
                <p> <br>If money is your goal, remember that most of the people who are wealthy today started out with
                  no money
                  at all, or even deeply in debt. Almost everyone who is on the top today was once at the bottom. Almost
                  everyone who is at the front of the line of life was once at the back of the line. Almost everyone who
                  is
                  wealthy today was once poor. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspMost of the five million millionaires in
                  the
                  United States are self-made. That is, they started out with nothing and worked their way up. Our world
                  today
                  has more than 300 self-made billionaires and multibillionaires as well. Many of these are people who
                  started
                  with little or nothing, and by changing their thinking, they unleashed their own inner potentials to
                  achieve
                  extraordinary financial results. And almost anything that anyone else has done, within reason, you can
                  do as
                  well.What are your goals? <br><br>
              <li><b>THE POWER OF COMMITMENT</b>
                <p> <br>One of my favorite quotations is from the mountain climber Charles Murray.
                <p> <i>Until one is
                    committed, there is hesitancy, the chance to draw back, always ineffectiveness. Concerning all acts
                    of
                    initiative and creation, there is an elementary truth, the ignorance of which kills countless ideas
                    and
                    splendid plans; that the moment that one definitely commits oneself, then providence moves too.</i>
                </p>
                <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp<i>All sorts of things occur to help one that would never otherwise have
                    occurred.A
                    whole stream of events issues from the decision, raising in one's favor all manner of unforeseen
                    incidences and meetings and material assistance that no man could have dreamed would have come his
                    way.</i></p>
                <p> <br><br>He finishes off his statement with these words from Goethe:
                <p> <i>Are you in earnest? Seek this
                    very minute, Whatever you can do, or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power, and magic
                    in
                    it. Only engage and the mind grows heated. Begin and then the task will be completed.</i></p>
                <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp<b>ACTION EXERCISES</b>
                <ol style="font-size:17px;"> <br><br>
                  <li>What one great goal would you set for yourself if you were absolutely guaranteed success? <br><br>
                  <li>Make out a ''dream list''; write down everything you would like to have in your life someday,
                    exactly
                    as if you had no limitations. <br><br>
                  <li>Imagine your perfect lifestyle; if you were financially independent and you could live any way and
                    anywhere you wanted, what would you change? <br><br>
                  <li>Make a list of 10 goals you would like to accomplish in the next year. From that list, select the
                    one
                    goal that would have the greatest positive impact on your life if you could achieve it right now.
                    <br><br>
                  <li>Write your most important goal on a separate piece of paper. Make it measurable and set a deadline
                    for
                    its accomplishment. <br><br>
                  <li>Make a written plan to achieve this one goal.Write out a list of everything you can think of that
                    you
                    will have to do to accomplish it. <br><br>
                  <li>Take action on your plan immediately. Once you have started, discipline yourself to do something
                    every
                    day that moves you toward that goal. Never miss a day until you have achieved it.

              <li><b>THREE MAJOR FORCES</b>
                <p> <br>There are three major forces reverberating through our world today, transforming everything they
                  touch and creating unlimited opportunities for the creative minority. These three forces are the
                  incredible growth in <i>information, technology, and competition.</i> <br><br>
              <li><b>THREE MAJOR FORCES</b>
                <ol>
                  <li>Information and Knowledge Explosion <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe information revolution,
                    combined with the speed of computerized information processing, the Internet, and wireless
                    communications, is enabling knowledge in every field to double every two or three years. Fully 90
                    percent of all the thinkers, inventors, engineers, scientists, writers, entrepreneurs, and creators
                    of all kinds who ever existed are living and working today. The results of their efforts are
                    becoming almost instantaneously available to each other, thereby doubling and tripling their
                    outputs. <br><br>
                  <li>Technological Advances <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe explosion in technology and high-speed
                    computers is literally breathtaking.Today, you can e-mail a message around the world to dozens,
                    hundreds, or even thousands of people simultaneously, in a matter of seconds, at a cost of pennies.
                    The World Wide Web gives you access to tens of millions of other Internet users, as well as to the
                    accumulated knowledge stored in more than 50,000 libraries and research institutes. Instantaneous
                    transmission of data enables the money markets to move a trillion dollars per day, sometimes in
                    seconds, making it impossible for countries to control their currencies, much less their economies.
                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn the twenty-first century, you will own a laptop computer with a
                    microchip that can process one billion commands per second. It will have a long-life battery and a
                    built-in cellular telephone, connected to cells and satellites that will enable you to communicate
                    instantaneously with almost anyone, almost anywhere in the world. You will have your own personal
                    telephone number that will enable anyone in the world, anywhere, to telephone you, wherever you are,
                    whether or not they even know what country you are in. And this telephone technology will probably
                    fit on your wrist like a large digital watch does today. <br><br>
                  <li>Thriving Competition <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe third major factor driving our lives is
                    competition. Every business organization wants to generate sales and make profits, locally,
                    nationally, and internationally, if possible. To survive and thrive, each person and business must
                    be continually seeking faster, better, newer, cheaper, easier ways to deliver value to their
                    customers. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspEvery advance in knowledge and technology creates
                    opportunities that fleet-footed competitors can grab and run with to create new products and
                    services to leapfrog each other in their markets. All three forces- information, technology, and
                    competition- are multiplying times each other to create the greatest rate of change in human
                    history. And if anything, the rate of change is going to increase in the years ahead.
                </ol> <br><br>
              <li><b>CHANGE CREATES OPPORTUNITIES</b>
                <p> <br>Fully 80 percent of the products and services that you will be using five years from now will be
                  brand-new or completely transformed from today. Probably 80 percent of the jobs being done in five
                  years will be new jobs or jobs that have been completely transformed by the onrush of information,
                  technology, and competition. And the good news is that every single change that takes place opens up
                  more opportunities and possibilities for you to achieve your goals and make greater progress, faster
                  than ever before. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe forces of change impact everything you do. The
                  rate of change is accelerating week by week and month by month. The speed and variety of change is
                  something over which you have no control, and about which you have no choice. The only decision you
                  have to make is whether you are going to be a ''master of change'' or a ''victim of change.'' Are you
                  going to be a creator of circumstances or a creature of circumstances? Are you going to ride the wave
                  and stay ahead of the curve of change, or are you going to be bowled over by it and left in its wake?
                  It will be one or the other, but the impact of change will be forced upon you, whatever you do.

              <li><b>LEARN FROM THE EXPERTS</b>
                <p> <br>If you want to learn how to cook, you study cooking. If you want to be a lawyer, you study law.
                  If you want to be an engineer or an architect, you study engineering or architecture. And if you want
                  to be financially successful, you study others who have become financially successful before you.You
                  find out what they did, and you do the same things, over and over, until you get the same results.
                  <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspMaking money is a skill, like riding a bicycle or operating a computer.
                  Because it is a skill, it is therefore learnable by anyone who wants to acquire wealth. If in the past
                  you have accepted the false idea that you cannot make or keep all the money you want, it is now time
                  for you to get rid of that idea. It is a false belief. It is time for you to decide to become
                  financially independent. <br><br>
              <li><b>THE GREAT LAW</b>
                <p> <br>The Greek philosopher Aristotle first articulated the foundation principle of Western philosophy
                  in about 350 B.C. It became known as the Aristotelian Principle of Causality.Today, we call it the Law
                  of Cause and Effect. This law says that for every effect in your life, there are specific causes. It
                  says that everything happens for a reason. Success is not an accident. Failure is not an accident,
                  either. What happens to you is not determined by luck or by coincidence. It is the result of
                  unchanging law. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspMy journey from unemployment and poverty to success and
                  financial independence started when I began to study the most successful people in our society. My
                  idea was simple: I would find out what they had done to accomplish so much, and then I would do the
                  same things. Why reinvent the wheel? What I discovered changed my life. It will change yours as well.

              <li><b>MILLIONS OF MILLIONAIRES</b>
                <p> <br>When I began my reading and research in the 1960s, there were seven hundred thousand
                  millionaires in the United States, mostly self-made, having started with nothing. By 1980, according
                  to the IRS, there were 1,800,000 families or individuals with a net worth of more than one million
                  dollars. Today, there are more than five million millionaires, an increase of 277 percent in 22 years.
                  And most of them are self-made as well.These are men and women who started with little or nothing,
                  often broke or deeply in debt, and who gradually accumulated enough money to become financially
                  independent. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspSelf-made millionaires come from every walk of life, with
                  every level of education and skill, and with every difficulty, obstacle, handicap, and challenge to
                  overcome that you could ever dream of. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspSome are young and some are old.
                  Some are new immigrants who arrived in America unable to speak English, and some are from families
                  that have been in America for generations. Some have excellent educations from the finest
                  universities, and some are high school dropouts. Some have superb physical health and others are in
                  wheelchairs, hard of hearing, blind, or have other physical limitations. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                  &nbspThe most important thing to remember is that no matter what difficulties you have, no matter what
                  problems you feel are holding you back, someone else, and probably thousands of other people, have had
                  far greater obstacles to overcome than you could possibly dream of, and they have gone on to become
                  successful nonetheless. And what others have done, you can do as well. <br><br>
              <li><b>EXHAUSTIVE RESEARCH</b>
                <p> <br>Dr. Thomas Stanley of the University of Georgia spent more than 30 years studying self-made
                  millionaires. He interviewed thousands of them and compiled his findings into a variety of books,
                  research studies, and reports, including two best-selling books, The Millionaire Next Door and The
                  Millionaire Mind. His research shows that every single kind of person, from every walk of life, has
                  been able to start from nothing and pass the magic million-dollar mark by doing certain things in
                  certain ways, over and over again. <br><br>
              <li><b>START WHERE YOU ARE</b>
                <p> <br>When I began studying self-made millionaires, I was living in a rented apartment with rented
                  furniture. I had a used car that was not paid for and I was deeply in debt. I was between jobs and
                  living off credit cards. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe first thing I found was that self-made
                  millionaires did things <i>differently</i> from average people, and I was tired of being
                  <i>average.</i> I therefore decided to stop doing what I was doing, which wasn't working, and to start
                  doing what they were doing. My life has never been the same since this decision. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                  &nbsp &nbspIt wasn't easy to change my thinking about money and my financial future, but eventually
                  these efforts began to pay off. Like a large ocean liner changing direction, one degree at a time,my
                  habits began to change. Within five years, I was out of debt and making good money. In another five
                  years, I passed the million-dollar mark. When I look back, I see that it was no miracle. All I really
                  did was to learn what other successful people had done before me and then do the same things until I
                  got the same results. <br><br>
              <li><b>GET RID OF THE MYTHS</b>
                <p> <br>There are a great many myths about self-made millionaires. If you want to become a self-made
                  millionaire yourself, you must dispel these myths from your own mind. Remember, as the humorist Josh
                  Billings once said, ''It's not what a man knows that hurts him; it's what he knows that isn't true.''
                  <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspMany people have fixed ideas or beliefs about themselves and money that
                  are holding them back. These ideas may be completely untrue, but they will cut off your chances of
                  success nonetheless. You must get over them. <i>To achieve something you've never achieved before, you
                    will have to think in ways that you have never thought before.</i> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                  &nbspOne myth is that you have to have a great education to become rich. Another myth is that you have
                  to start off with a lot of money. Some people are convinced that financial success depends on getting
                  a lucky break of some kind, like picking a hot stock in the stock market. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                  &nbspNone of these myths are true. In fact, a survey of members of the Forbes 400, the 400 richest men
                  and women in the United States, found that high school dropouts in the group who made it to the list
                  were worth, on average, $300 million more than university graduates on the list. <br><br>
              <li><b>THE LAND OF OPPORTUNITY</b>
                <p> <br>The most successful immigrant group per capita in the United States, in terms of starting and
                  building successful businesses, are Russians.Why is this so? It is because the Russians have come from
                  a system where it has been so extraordinarily difficult to succeed that when they arrive in America,
                  believing that America is the land of opportunity, they find that it is much easier to succeed than
                  they have ever experienced. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAs a result, Russians start business after
                  business and achieve successes that the average American continually claims are no longer possible.
                  Because they absolutely believe that it is possible for them, they make their dreams come true. Their
                  beliefs become their realities. <br><br>
              <li><b>THE REALITY PRINCIPLE</b>
                <p> <br>The past president of General Electric Company, Jack Welch, was considered to be one of the best
                  business executives in the world. He said that the most important single quality of leadership is what
                  he calls the ''reality principle.'' The reality principle says that <i>you must deal with the world as
                    it is, not as you wish it would be.</i>You must strive to be completely honest with yourself and
                  your situation.You must refuse to engage in self-delusion and the hope that things will work out
                  whether or not you do anything about them. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspEspecially when it comes to
                  building wealth, you must be totally honest with yourself. You cannot afford to play games with your
                  own mind if you truly want to be wealthy.You cannot wish and hope and pray that somehow you are going
                  to win the lottery or strike it rich as a result of luck or some remarkable external circumstance.
                  <br><br>
              <li><b>YOU CREATE YOUR OWN LUCK</b>
                <p> <br>Often people ask me about the role of luck in success.They are convinced that luck is a critical
                  factor in achieving anything worthwhile. They feel that some people are just lucky and some are not.
                  They talk about luck as if it were a matter of fate or destiny, largely inexplicable. They insist that
                  a person gets to the top of his field largely as the result of getting lucky breaks, which they, of
                  course, did not get. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspI have studied the concept of luck for many years.
                  My conclusion is that luck is a word that people use to explain away things that turn out much better
                  than could have been expected. If a person achieves great financial success at a young age, people say
                  he was ''just lucky.'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspSome people use luck to describe something
                  remarkably good that happens that is out of the ordinary. But it is not luck at all.The fact is that
                  all so-called lucky outcomes are really the result of probabilities. There is no such thing as luck.
                  <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe Law of Probabilities says that there is a probability for
                  everything that happens. These probabilities can often be determined with considerable accuracy. The
                  entire insurance and underwriting industry is based on probabilities, which are expressed in actuarial
                  tables. <br><br>
              <li><b>BECOMING A MILLIONAIRE</b>
                <p> <br>There is a probability that you will become a millionaire in the course of your working
                  lifetime. Today in America, one family in 20 has a net worth of more than one million dollars. This
                  means that your likelihood of acquiring a million dollars is one in 20, or 5 percent. <br><br>&nbsp
                  &nbsp &nbsp &nbspHowever, this also means that your likelihood of not acquiring one million dollars,
                  should that be your goal, is 95 percent. These are not good odds.Your job must be to improve the odds
                  in your favor. Your aim should be to dramatically increase the probabilities of achieving financial
                  independence by doing more and more of those things that will help you to achieve your goal. This
                  principle applies to anything you want to accomplish. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe more
                  different things you do that are likely to help you to achieve your goal, the more likely it is you
                  will do the right thing at the right time. If you set clear, written goals, make detailed plans, and
                  continually upgrade your skills to increase your income, you increase the probabilities that you will
                  earn a good living. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIf you study money and investments, save and put
                  aside 10 percent to 20 percent of your income every month, keep tight control over your expenses, and
                  think long-term about your financial life, you will eventually become a millionaire. It is not a
                  matter of luck. It is just a matter of probabilities. <br><br>
              <li><b>PROBABILITIES ARE EVERYTHING</b>
                <p> <br>Imagine you are an inexperienced dart thrower, slightly inebriated, in a darkened room, standing
                  some distance from the dartboard. Even under these conditions, if you throw enough darts in the
                  direction of the dartboard, you would eventually hit it. And if you continued to throw darts, almost
                  in spite of yourself you would become more accurate. As a result, by the law of probabilities, you
                  would eventually hit a bull's-eye. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThis metaphor explains why people
                  who start off with high levels of desire and determination ultimately succeed. They just keep trying.
                  And by the law of probabilities, they finally win. It is not luck. They create their own luck by what
                  they do, or what they fail to do. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspNow, imagine the conditions are
                  different. Imagine that you are a skilled dart thrower, and that you practice every day to get better.
                  In addition, you are fully rested, clear-headed, and completely prepared. The lights in the room are
                  bright and you stand at a reasonable distance from the dartboard. Under these conditions, all of which
                  are under your control, the time it would take you to hit a bull's-eye would be greatly reduced. And
                  of course, when you do hit a bull's-eye, everyone would tell you how ''lucky'' you were. But you made
                  your own luck. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThroughout your life, you must be constantly thinking
                  about all the things you can do, in every area, to increase the probabilities that you will be
                  successful in achieving your goals. You should leave nothing to chance. You should refuse to wish or
                  hope, or trust to luck.You must take control of your situation.You are responsible. <br><br>
              <li><b>YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE</b>
                <p> <br>You will achieve financial success only after you accept that everything that you ever become is
                  completely up to you.You are responsible. No one is going to do it for you. Keep repeating, <i>''If
                    it's to be, it's up to me!''</i> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspFortunately, in America there are
                  more opportunities for wealth creation and personal success than have ever existed previously in all
                  of human history.The United States is the only country on earth that is commonly referred to overseas
                  as ''the land of dreams.'' In 2003, it was rated as the <i>most entrepreneurial country</i> in the
                  world. This means that it is easier to start and build a successful business in the United States than
                  it is anywhere else on earth. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAs information and technology continue to
                  expand and multiply times each other, and competition continues to intensify, more and more
                  opportunities are opening up every day for the creative minority who are willing to take advantage of
                  them.Your job is to find these opportunities, and if you don't find them, <i>create them</i> for
                  yourself. <br><br>
              <li><b>THE COMMON DENOMINATOR</b>
                <p> <br>One of the discoveries in the research on self-made millionaires is the finding that most of
                  them start off with little or no money. Most of them start off by saving their money carefully for a
                  long time until they have enough to start a small enterprise or business. Some of the biggest
                  companies in America were started on a kitchen table or in a garage, like the Hewlett-Packard Company
                  or Apple Computer. Some of the newest millionaires in America come from the field of multilevel
                  marketing.Working from home, they paid $50 for a sample kit and went out to work. They sold something,
                  made a profit, reinvested their profits, grew larger, and eventually achieved financial independence.
                  <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn Dr. Thomas Stanley's interviews with self-made millionaires, he
                  discovered their common denominator of success. The most important quality that self-made millionaires
                  used to explain their success was the habit of <i>hard, hard work.</i> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                  &nbspSelf-made millionaires work much harder than the average person. They start earlier, work harder,
                  and stay later. According to many studies and interviews, self-made millionaires work an average of 59
                  hours per week. Some work considerably more, especially at the beginning. <br><br>
              <li><b>WASTING TIME AT WORK</b>
                <p> <br>The average employed person puts in about 40 hours per week on the job, but only about 32 hours
                  of that is officially working time. Fully 50 percent of time spent at work is wasted in idle
                  socializing with co-workers, personal telephone calls, and personal business. Average employees start
                  a little later, take long coffee breaks and lunch hours, and leave a little earlier. Even managers
                  privately report that they spend fully half of the time they are at work doing things that have
                  absolutely nothing whatever to do with the job. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOnly about 5 percent of
                  people working today work full-time on their jobs from the time they begin each day until the time
                  they finish. These people are the ones on the fast track in their careers.They are moving upward and
                  onward, getting paid more and being promoted faster. They are the movers and shakers in every
                  business, and everyone knows who they are. <br><br>
              <li><b>LOW-VALUE ACTIVITIES</b>
                <p> <br>The saddest part of the research into employee work habits is not just that people waste a lot
                  of time at work. It is that in the other 50 percent of the time, when people are actually working on
                  company tasks and responsibilities, they tend to work on low-value, low-priority tasks. As a result,
                  they contribute little of value to their companies. Low productivity leads to lower wages and fewer
                  opportunities. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspEvery year, hundreds of thousands of people are laid off
                  from large and small corporations, often from white-collar, midmanagement jobs.Why is this? The answer
                  is simple. The companies have finally learned that they are paying high salaries to people who are
                  producing very little of value. No company can survive very long under these conditions, and these
                  companies are determined to survive. So the redundant staff has to go. <br><br>
              <li><b>YOU CAN DO IT</b>
                <p> <br>If you are serious about becoming financially independent, or even better, becoming a
                  <i>self-made millionaire</i> over the course of your career, here are two facts: First, it is
                  definitely possible. Hundreds of thousands of men and women become financially independent each year
                  after having started from nothing.Whatever others have done, within reason, you can do as well. The
                  very fact that someone else has achieved a particular financial goal is proof it is possible for you.
                  The only question is, how badly do you want it? <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspSecond, the reality
                  principle says that if you want to be successful in any area, you have to find out what other
                  successful people have done to succeed in that area, and then do the same things over and over until
                  you get the same results. As long as you don't try to fool yourself and look for shortcuts, you are
                  virtually assured of eventually achieving, and even exceeding, your goals. <br><br>
              <li><b>THE 40 PLUS FORMULA</b>
                <p> <br>Begin today to apply the ''40 Plus Formula'' to your work and your career. This formula says
                  that you work 40 hours per week in the United States for survival. If you work only 40 hours per week
                  - if you work only the number of hours that are required of you - then all you will ever do is
                  survive.You will tread water financially.You will make enough to pay your bills and perhaps a little
                  more besides, but you will never get ahead and you will never be successful. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                  &nbspAccording to the 40 Plus Formula, every hour that you put in over 40 hours on your job, or on
                  yourself, is an investment in your future success.You can tell where you are going to be five years
                  from now by simply looking at how many hours per week you put in on your job. Every hour over 40 that
                  you invest in getting more results for your employer and your customers adds up and contributes to
                  your long-term success. <br><br>
              <li><b>GIVE YOURSELF AN EDGE</b>
                <p> <br>If you work 45 to 50 hours per week, you give yourself an edge over your co-workers. If you work
                  55 to 60 hours per week, your longterm success is virtually guaranteed.You put yourself on the side of
                  the angels. Many self-made millionaires work 70 to 80 hours per week to get established in their
                  careers. There are no shortcuts to lasting success. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspI have studied
                  successful men and women in America for more than 25 years. I have never found a single successful
                  person who got there working only 40 hours, or five days per week. The idea of the five-day week,
                  which was promoted by the labor unions as a great advance in the life of the working person, has been
                  the cause of more financial underachievement and failure than perhaps any other single myth.
                  <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe fact is that, especially at the beginning of their careers, all
                  really successful people work much harder than the average person. They work 10 to 12 hours per day,
                  six days per week. They work at this rate for many months and years, before they reach the point where
                  they can slow down. The average self-made millionaire has taken 22 years to get from being broke to
                  having a net worth of more than one million dollars. It is not easy and it is not quick. But it is
                  definitely possible if you want it badly enough. <br><br>
              <li><b>WORK ALL THE TIME YOU WORK</b>
                <p> <br>A key part of success at work is to use your time well, to focus on results, and avoid the
                  time-wasting social activities of the poor performers. In correlation with this is the need for you to
                  ''work all the time you work.'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThis is a remarkable idea for many
                  people. Often employees think about work as if it was an extension of school.When they were growing
                  up, they came to think of school as a place where you go to socialize. You take the required courses,
                  but the most important part is spending time with your friends between classes. School becomes a form
                  of play. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspMany people think, when they take their first job, that work
                  is also a place where you go to spend time with your friends. This is why fully half of the working
                  day is spent socializing, and in idle conversation on the telephone with friends and family.Work is
                  seen as a giant sandbox where you continue to play as you did in school. You do a little work when the
                  boss is watching, get a paycheck, and then go home. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspBut this is not for
                  you. If you are determined to succeed greatly and be paid the very most, you must <i>work all the time
                    you work.</i> When you go to work, you must put your head down and work wholeheartedly. <br><br>
              <li><b>SOCIALIZING WITH CO-WORKERS</b>
                <p> <br>Many people believe the myth that you have to spend a lot of time getting along with your
                  co-workers. They say, ''Work is supposed to be fun!'' And this is true up to a point. <br><br>&nbsp
                  &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOf course, it is important for you to be positive and agreeable person to work with.
                  But you can accomplish this in a few minutes of pleasant interaction each day. You don't have to spend
                  endless hours chatting about sports, television shows, and family activities. Your job is to work all
                  the time you work. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen you work, you work.You do not pick up your dry
                  cleaning or drop off your laundry during working hours.You do not socialize with your friends or chat
                  on the phone with your family.You do not take long coffee breaks and extended lunch hours.You work all
                  the time you work.You commit yourself to getting the very most done that you possibly can in the time
                  that you have available to you. <br><br>
              <li><b>GET BACK TO WORK</b>
                <p> <br>Your goal is to earn the reputation around your company as being the hardest-working person in
                  the organization. If someone wants to shoot the breeze with you, explain to him or her that you would
                  be pleased to chat after work, but right now you have to get back to work. Keep repeating to yourself,
                  ''Back to work, back to work, back to work!'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspPeople who achieve great
                  financial success, either in their own businesses or working for other organizations, are people who
                  very early develop a reputation for hard, hard work. There is a saying in business: <i>''Everyone
                    knows everything.''</i> There are no secrets. Everyone knows who works the hardest in every
                  organization, and who doesn't. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThere is no quality that will bring you
                  to the attention of people who can help you <i>faster</i> than your developing a reputation for being
                  one of the hardest-working people in your company. <br><br>
              <li><b>START EARLIER, STAY LATER</b>
                <p> <br>Napoleon Hill, the author of <i>Think and Grow Rich,</i> once told the story of a young man who
                  started at the bottom of a large organization and eventually moved up into the top ranks of
                  executives, passing all the people who had started with him at the same level. His strategy was
                  simple. He noticed that his boss came in a little earlier than the rest of the staff, stayed to finish
                  up his work, and left a little later than the others. This young man therefore resolved to arrive 15
                  minutes before his boss and to leave 15 minutes after his boss left. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspHe
                  put his resolution into action the next day. This is another hallmark of high achievers:They don't
                  procrastinate when they have a good idea; they take action immediately. The young man began coming in
                  15 minutes before his boss and going straight to work, continuing all day. When his boss left he would
                  still be at his desk, working away. <br><br>
              <li><b>BE PATIENT AND PERSISTENT</b>
                <p> <br>The boss said nothing for several weeks. Finally, after work one evening, his boss came over to
                  his desk and asked him why he always seemed to be there, even though all his co-workers had left. The
                  young man said it was because he was really determined to be successful in this company, and he knew
                  he couldn't be successful unless he was willing to work harder than anyone else. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                  &nbsp &nbspThe boss smiled and nodded and went on his way. Soon after that, the boss asked him to do
                  something that was not part of his job description. He did it quickly and well, delivered it to his
                  boss, and went back to his desk. Soon after, he was given another assignment, which he also completed
                  quickly. Within a year, the young man had been given several additional responsibilities, each one of
                  which he accepted and fulfilled immediately. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn his second year, he was
                  promoted to a higher position. He studied, upgraded his skills, and continued to work hard. Within a
                  couple of years he had surpassed all of his rivals. He had earned the respect and esteem of the other
                  managers.They soon promoted him so that he was one of them, rather than one of the staff. His career
                  took off. Eventually he became a vice president of the company. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThis is
                  a simple strategy that works for anyone who is willing to do more than is expected of him or her. It
                  works for almost anyone, anywhere, over and over again, year after year. <br><br>
              <li><b>LOOK FOR WAYS TO ADD VALUE</b>
                <p> <br>If your goal is to become wealthy, you have to know how wealth is created. The answer is
                  contained in two words: ''add value.'' All wealth comes from adding value in some way. All wealth
                  comes from serving and satisfying your customers better than they could be served and satisfied by
                  someone else. Wealth is the result of adding value to them in a way that no one else can match.
                  <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn your job, you should be looking for ways every day and every week to
                  add value and to become more valuable than you were before. Throughout your career, your main focus
                  must be to constantly seek out ways that you can add value to your boss, to your co-workers, to your
                  customers, to your suppliers, and to everyone else and anyone upon whom you rely for your success.
                  This should become your motto: <i>''Add value, add value, add value!''</i> <br><br>
              <li><b>THE NEW PARADIGM OF WORK</b>
                <p> <br>One of the major revolutions in thought that has taken place in the world of work in the past
                  few years is the idea that you must justify your position anew every day. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                  &nbspIt used to be that a person would work hard for a few years until he had achieved a certain level
                  in his job. He could then coast along at that level for many years, if not for the rest of his career.
                  His attitude was, ''Well, I've paid my dues. I earned my position. I did a great job. Now I am
                  entitled to this job indefinitely.'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspBut this is no longer good enough.
                  Today, everybody wants to know, <i>''What have you accomplished lately?''</i> In the fast-moving,
                  highly competitive business world of today, your boss wants to know what you have done to add value
                  recently.You have already been paid for what you did last year, last month, and even last week. Now
                  you must earn and justify your paycheck anew. There is a race on and you are in it, whether you know
                  it or not. <br><br>
              <li><b>TWO SOURCES OF VALUE</b>
                <p> <br>There are two major sources of value in the world of work today. The first is <i>time</i> and
                  the <i>second</i> is knowledge. Today, time is the currency of modern business. Everyone must be
                  focused on reducing the amount of time that it takes to get the same results. Customers will pay
                  dearly for anyone who can reduce the time needed to get them the products and services they want.
                  People will pay more for someone who can satisfy their needs faster than someone else. This is why
                  most of the major improvements in modern management are those that reduce the amount of time that it
                  takes to get the job done. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe most important measure of time is
                  <i>speed.</i> The most important quality that you can develop with regard to time is a ''sense of
                  urgency.'' This is the habit of moving fast when opportunity presents itself to you. Develop a bias
                  for action. Fast tempo is essential to success. All successful people not only work hard, hard, hard,
                  but they work fast, fast, fast! <br><br>
              <li><b>DO IT NOW!</b>
                <p> <br>Procrastination is not only the thief of time; it is the thief of life.To outperform your
                  competition, both inside and outside your organization, you must develop the habit of moving
                  <i>quickly</i> when something needs to be done. You must develop a reputation for speed and
                  dependability. Study after study shows that those individuals with the best reputations for speed and
                  dependability are the most valued in any organization. They are very quickly promoted onto the fast
                  track in their careers. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe wonderful advantage of developing the habit
                  of moving fast is that the faster you move, the <i>better</i> you get. This is because the faster you
                  move, the more experience you get. The faster you move, the more you learn and the more competent you
                  become.The faster you move, the more energy and enthusiasm you have. People who move fast as a way of
                  life soon develop a totally different temperament and personality than people who move slowly or who
                  take a casual attitude toward their work. <br><br>
              <li><b>WORK IN REAL TIME</b>
                <p> <br>Whenever possible, do your work in ''real time,'' as soon as it comes up. Do it now. It is
                  amazing how much time you can waste by picking up a task, looking at it or starting it, and then
                  putting it down and coming back to it again and again. As a general rule, small tasks should be done
                  immediately, as soon as they appear.This habit of taking action quickly will enable you to get through
                  an enormous amount of work in a day. It will earn you a reputation for being the kind of person to
                  give jobs to when someone needs them done quickly. <br><br>
              <li><b>SUCCESS COMES FROM GOOD HABITS</b>
                <p> <br>Fully 95 percent of everything you do throughout your day is based on habit. Successful people
                  are those who have developed the habits of success. Successful people form good habits and ensure that
                  those habits govern their behaviors. Unsuccessful people allow bad habits to form, and these bad
                  habits then lead to frustration and failure. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspMy friend Ed Foreman says,
                  <i>''Good habits are hard to form but easy to live with. Bad habits, on the other hand, are easy to
                    form but hard to live with.''</i> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspA habit is defined as ''a
                  conditioned response to stimuli.'' It is an automatic way of responding or reacting in a particular
                  situation. You develop a habit by repeating a specific act or way of thinking and reacting. Once it
                  becomes a habit, it becomes easier to do it that way than to do it some other way.What kind of habits
                  do you have? <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspSuccessful people are simply those who developed
                  successful habits. They have trained themselves, like athletes, to do certain things in a certain way,
                  over and over again, until they do them automatically, without even thinking about them.You may have
                  heard the old saying:
                <p> <i>Sow a thought and you reap an action; Sow an action and you reap a habit; Sow a habit and you
                    reap a character; Sow a character and you reap a destiny.</i></p> <br><br>
              <li><b>A KEY SUCCESS HABIT</b>
                <p> <br>One of the habits of success is that of <i>early rising.</i> Successful people get up a little
                  bit earlier, read and prepare, plan and organize their day on paper in advance, and get going before
                  the average person has even started.Thomas Jefferson said, ''The sun has never caught me in my bed.''
                  <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspA woman in one of my seminars some years ago told me that she
                  discovered the magic of early rising. She had found that by going to bed early she could get up at
                  four o'clock in the morning. She could then do the equivalent of a full day's work by seven or eight
                  o'clock, before the average person even got started. In no time at all, she was producing and earning
                  double the amount of her coworkers. She was continually promoted and paid more money because she was
                  getting far more done than anyone else. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspSuccessful people make a habit
                  of getting up early, usually by 6:00 or 6:30 in the morning, sometimes earlier, and then getting going
                  immediately. This gives them a great jump on the day. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe average
                  person, on the other hand, takes a full hour to get up and get going in the morning. Then they drag
                  themselves off to work, thinking about lunchtime, and what they are going to do in the evening.
                  <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen your alarm clock goes off, get up immediately and get going right
                  away. Start moving. Develop the habit of rising early and starting right to work on your most
                  important task. This habit can do as much to assure your success as any other habit you develop.
                  <br><br>
              <li><b>PRACTICE LOMBARDI TIME</b>
                <p> <br>When Vince Lombardi took over the Green Bay Packers, the players had developed the habit of not
                  showing up until the last moment for games or buses. Often they were late, and everyone had to wait.
                  So Lombardi introduced ''Lombardi time.'' This was defined as 15 minutes earlier than the scheduled
                  time. Eventually everyone began arriving early, and the problem was solved. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                  &nbspYou should go onto Lombardi time as well. Make a habit of punctuality by resolving to be on time,
                  and then practicing it over and over until is natural and easy. Less than 2 percent of people are
                  punctual, and everybody notices it, one way or the other. Make it a game to be on time - or better
                  yet, early - for every appointment. <br><br>
              <li><b>MAKE EVERY MINUTE COUNT</b>
                <p> <br>Get into work before anyone else gets there, and when you do arrive, begin working immediately.
                  Don't waste time reading the newspaper, drinking coffee, or socializing with co-workers. Develop a
                  reputation for being the kind of person who is always working, and always working on high-priority
                  tasks. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWork all the time you work. Discipline yourself to keep yourself
                  focused on the most valuable use of your time. Don't allow other people to put you ''off your
                  game.''When you have coffee breaks or lunches, have them when they best suit you, not when they best
                  suit the clock. <br><br>
              <li><b>MAKE EVERY MINUTE COUNT</b>
                <p> <br>Here is a powerful three-step formula you can use to double your productivity and perhaps even
                  double your income over the next 12 months. It is simple and powerful, and it works for anyone who
                  uses it. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspFirst, make a decision to come into work an hour earlier. This
                  does not take very much effort, and it allows you to beat the traffic. Have your work planned out for
                  the day so that when you get into work you can then put your head down and go full blast.You will be
                  amazed at how much you can get done before anyone else comes in. Research proves that you can do three
                  hours of office work in one hour of uninterrupted time. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspSecond, work
                  through lunch, using the hour when your coworkers are all off together eating to get ahead of your
                  work. Resist the tendency to take an hour off at ''lunchtime'' or to go for lunch with whoever is
                  standing there. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThird, work one hour later, after everyone has left.
                  This third uninterrupted hour will enable you to wrap up your work from the day and plan the next day
                  in detail. Also, by working later, you will miss the rush hour traffic. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                  &nbspBy starting one hour early, working through the usual lunch hour, and staying one hour later, you
                  will double your productive working time each day.When you combine this with working all the time you
                  work and focusing on high-value tasks, you will more than double the amount of work you get done.You
                  will quickly become one of the most valuable people in your organization. <br><br>
              <li><b>SCHEDULE YOUR FIRST APPOINTMENT EARLY</b>
                <p> <br>If you are in sales, schedule your first appointment as early as possible. Many of the most
                  important people you could want to see get into the office at 7:00 and 7:30 in the morning. Arrange to
                  meet them at that time. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspA salesman friend of mine, who is at the top of
                  his field, found that the key to getting appointments with the key decision makers was to call their
                  offices at 7:00 or 7:30 in the morning or 6:30 or 7:00 in the evening. He discovered that at these
                  times all the staff either weren't in yet or had gone home. The only people working were the key
                  people. They would answer the phone personally and he would get an opportunity to talk to them and
                  arrange to see them later. <br><br>
              <li><b>CREATE YOUR OWN OPPORTUNITIES</b>
                <p> <br>Develop the habit of moving fast. Successful people in every field have a sense of urgency. Only
                  a small percentage of the population moves quickly when opportunity or responsibility presents itself.
                  You must be a member of this small percentage. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen I was younger, I
                  used to think that when my opportunity came along I would take advantage of it at that time. I soon
                  learned that your opportunity never does just come along. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspRussell
                  Conwell made this point in his famous story, <i>Acres of Diamonds</i> (Berkley, 1986). In summary, it
                  says that in most cases your greatest opportunities lie under your own feet. They are right where you
                  are. They lie within your current talents, skills, ability, and experience. They lie within your own
                  business or industry. They lie within your own background or career.Your acres of diamonds are very
                  close at hand, and that is where you should begin your search. <br><br>
              <li><b>TAKE ACTION RIGHT WHERE YOU ARE</b>
                <p> <br>Theodore Roosevelt once said, <i>''Do what you can, with what you have, right where you
                    are.''</i> This is the key to success. <i>''Do what you can, with what you have, right where you
                    are.''</i> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspFocus on the present moment and on your current situation.
                  Don't wait for things to be ''just right.'' It is you who will make things just right. By throwing
                  your whole heart into what you are doing every minute, you will open up doors of opportunity that are
                  not now visible to you. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspLook around you at this very moment and ask
                  yourself, ''What could I do to add value to the most important people in my work life?''What could you
                  do to make things faster, easier, or better for the people who are depending on you? Be proactive
                  rather than reactive. Be the kind of person who reaches out and grabs opportunities, and if you don't
                  have any opportunities, create them personally through your own efforts. <br><br>
              <li><b>MAKE YOURSELF INDISPENSABLE</b>
                <p> <br>A secretary in Boca Raton, Florida, told me an interesting story at one of my seminars. She had
                  listened to one of my audio programs on personal achievement. As a result, she had set a goal to
                  increase her income by 50 percent over the coming year from her current income of $1,500 per month.
                  She told me that she didn't really think it was possible to earn that much more because she was part
                  of a large secretarial pool where salaries were fixed. Everyone made almost exactly the same.
                  <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspNonetheless, she decided to look for ways to add value to her boss. She
                  noticed that he spent a lot of time replying to routine correspondence. One day, she took all of his
                  regular mail and wrote replies to them. She then took the finished letters to him to edit and sign. He
                  was delighted with her work and encouraged her to do more of it. Soon, she was handling 90 percent of
                  his routine correspondence. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspShe then began to take additional courses
                  to upgrade her skills in word processing, page making, and report preparation. Bit by bit, she began
                  to take his smaller tasks and handle them herself. Each time she took over a smaller task, she freed
                  her boss to work on more important tasks. And he noticed. <br><br>
              <li><b>MAKE YOURSELF INDISPENSABLE</b>
                <p> <br>After about three months her boss called her in and closed the door. He said that he really
                  appreciated the work that she was doing for him, and he wanted to increase her pay. He asked her not
                  to tell anyone else so that it didn't create any waves around the office. He then raised her salary
                  from $1,500 to $1,750 per month. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspShe thanked him, and continued looking
                  for ways to help him in his job. Three months later, he increased her pay again, and three months
                  later, he increased her salary once more. By the end of the year, she was earning $2,250 per month, a
                  50 percent increase, while the other secretaries around her were still earning an average of $1,500.
                  <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspShe said it was absolutely amazing what happened when she began to
                  focus all of her energies on adding value to her boss and to her company. And this same strategy can
                  work for you. <br><br>
              <li><b>SERVE PEOPLE BETTER</b>
                <p> <br>Every job is an opportunity for you to solve problems and to satisfy the needs of other people.
                  Since the problems and needs that people have are unlimited, your opportunities to create value are
                  unlimited as well. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspEvery fortune begins with an idea to serve people
                  better in some way. Almost all entrepreneurs who start and build successful companies have worked for
                  other organizations where they continually looked for ways to increase their value to the company.
                  <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe primary sources of value, the keys to wealth building, are
                  <i>time</i> and <i>knowledge</i>.Your job is to continually increase your knowledge so that the value
                  of what you do becomes greater and greater. Over 400 years ago Francis Bacon said that <i>knowledge is
                    power.</i> But this is only partially true. Only when knowledge is applied to some good purpose is
                  it power.Your job is to gather the knowledge that you need so that you can do your job fast and well.
                  <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThere is a saying in Texas that goes, <i>''It's not the size of the dog
                    in the fight; it's the size of the fight in the dog.''</i> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhat is
                  most important is not the hours you put in, but the value of the work you put into those hours.Your
                  success is determined by your ability to contribute value to your current job, either as an employee
                  or as an employer, as a company worker or a company owner, that determines your income and your
                  financial future. <br><br>
              <li><b>PRODUCE MORE VALUE</b>
                <p> <br>In its simplest terms, successful people are <i>more productive</i> than unsuccessful people.
                  Successful people have better habits. They dream bigger dreams.They work from written goals.They do
                  what they love to do, and they concentrate on getting better and better at it. They use their natural
                  abilities to the fullest. They are continually generating ideas to solve problems and to achieve
                  company goals.They focus on using every minute of their time to get maximum results. <br><br>&nbsp
                  &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAbove all, they are constantly looking around them for opportunities to add value to
                  everything they do. They have a sense of urgency and a bias for action.They work all the time they
                  work.They develop and maintain a sense of forward momentum. As a result, they soon become unstoppable.
                  <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp<b>ACTION EXERCISES</b>
                <ol> <br><br>
                  <li>Identify the most valuable things you do at work. How could you organize your time so that you do
                    more of them? <br><br>
                  <li>Resolve today to develop the habit of punctuality. Go on Lombardi time, and start arriving 15
                    minutes early for appointments. <br><br>
                  <li>Organize your day so that you come in and get started one hour earlier than your co-workers.Work
                    through lunchtime, and stay one hour later. <br><br>
                  <li>Work all the time you work. Don't waste a minute. If someone tries to distract you, say you have
                    to get back to work, and then do it. <br><br>
                  <li>Look under your own feet for your personal acres of diamonds, opportunities to add more value
                    right where you are. What could they be? <br><br>
                  <li>Resolve today to become financially independent. Become a student of money, wealth accumulation,
                    and wealth creation. Becoming rich is a skill that you can learn. <br><br>
                  <li>Begin today to implement the 40 Plus Formula in your daily work life.Work on your job, or work on
                    yourself to get better at what you do, 50 to 60 hours each week. Put yourself on the side of the
                    angels.

            <p> <b><i>The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today. Let us move forward
                  with strong and active faith.</i></b></p>
            <p> <b>- Franklin Delano Roosevelt</b></p> <br><br>
            <li><b>THE GREAT TRUTH</b>
              <p> <br><i>''You can learn anything you need to learn, to accomplish any goal you can set for
                  yourself.''</i> This principle offers a way for you to take complete control over your future. When I
                was young and struggling, failing and frustrated, this principle came along to change my life.
                <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspGenerally speaking, <i>no one is smarter than you, and no one is better
                  than you.</i> Just because someone is doing better than you doesn't mean that he is better than you.
                It usually means that he has just learned how to succeed in his particular field before you have. And
                whatever someone else has done, you can probably do as well. There are few limits. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                &nbsp &nbspThis is not an easy rule, but it is definitely <i>simple.</i>You, too, can learn anything you
                need to learn to accomplish any goal you can set for yourself. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOnce I
                learned this idea, I was unafraid to change jobs, and even industries. I learned how to sell
                advertising, investments, automobiles, and office supplies. I worked in real estate sales and leasing,
                and then real estate development. Then I engaged in importation and distribution, then banking,
                printing, consulting, and eventually speaking, writing, recording, and corporate training. <br><br>
            <li><b>LEARN WHAT YOU NEED</b>
              <p> <br>Every time I entered into a new field, I went out and learned everything I possibly could about
                that field, and then applied it as fast as I could. At first, I checked out the books from the local
                library.Then, I bought my own books and built my own library. I listened to every audiocassette I could
                buy on the subject, and attended every seminar. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen I was 31, I studied
                and prepared myself, and then took the entrance exams to get into a major university. I invested several
                thousand hours of study to get a business degree. I learned the intricacies of micro- and macroeconomic
                theory, statistics, probability theory, management science, and accounting. I studied marketing,
                management, administration, and strategic planning. I became devoted to the concept of learning.
                <br><br>
            <li><b>THE GREAT MYSTERY</b>
              <p> <br>I thought I had come late to the party, that everyone knew that learning was the key to the
                future. I was amazed and perplexed to find, when I looked around me, that very few other people were
                doing what I was doing. Most people, by their own admission, were ''living lives of quiet desperation,''
                in Thoreau's words. They were working at jobs they didn't like, earning salaries far below their
                potentials, staying in relationships they didn't enjoy, and living lives that gave them no satisfaction.
                <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspI tried to tell them that the way out was up. I told anyone who would
                listen that they could learn anything they needed to learn to achieve any goal they could set for
                themselves.There were no limits. But few people seemed to be listening. <br><br>
            <li><b>REASONS FOR EVERYTHING</b>
              <p> <br>We live in an orderly universe. Everything happens for a reason. When I found that the people
                around me didn't seem to be interested in changing their situations, I began looking for the reasons
                underlying their behaviors. And I found them. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspPsychologists and scholars
                have spent many years researching the psychology of success and the psychology of failure. And most of
                the studies conclude that there are two major mental blocks that hold people back. The first is what Dr.
                Martin Seligman of the University of Pennsylvania, in his book, Learned Optimism (Knopf, 1990), calls
                ''learned helplessness.'' According to his research, this attitude afflicts fully 80 percent of the
                population to some degree, and for many people it is their major obstacle to success and fulfillment.
                <br><br>
            <li><b>FEELING TRAPPED</b>
              <p> <br>As the result of childhood experiences, especially destructive criticism and early failure
                experiences, people eventually reach the point where they feel helpless to change or to take action in
                different areas of their lives.The majority of men and women feel overwhelmed by things that seem to
                happen to them, and the many things going on around them. They feel that there is nothing they can do to
                influence events or to improve their lives. The most obvious proof that an individual is experiencing
                learned helplessness is the repeated use of the words ''I can't.'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspPeople
                feel that they can't lose weight, can't get a better job, can't improve or change their relationships,
                can't increase their incomes, can't upgrade their knowledge and skills, and can't do many other things
                that they really want to do. They have tried unsuccessfully so many times in the past that they have
                come to conclude automatically that there is very little they can do to change the future. They become
                passive and accepting of their situations. Their lives consist of getting up in the morning, going to
                work, socializing a bit, coming home, eating dinner, watching television for four or five hours, and
                then going off to bed. <br><br>
            <li><b>THE TRAP OF COMPLACENCY</b>
              <p> <br>The second mental condition that holds people back is called the ''comfort zone.'' Human beings
                are creatures of habit. They begin an activity of any kind and they soon become comfortable with it.
                They then become extremely reluctant to change what they are doing, or change the situation they are in,
                even if they are not particularly happy or satisfied with it.They become somewhat content and
                complacent. Eventually, they become afraid to change, for any reason. They get into a rut, and the
                longer they stay in their rut, the deeper it grows, until they finally give up all hope of ever changing
                or improving their lives. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp<i>Learned helplessness,</i> in combination
                with the <i>comfort zone</i>, creates a person who feels trapped and helpless, weak and powerless, and
                unable to take control or to make any real difference in his life. The individual in this mental state
                then strives for security rather than opportunity, and often feels like a victim of circumstances over
                which he has no control. <br><br>
            <li><b>NO REAL LIMITS</b>
              <p> <br>But the reality is that there are no real limits on what you can accomplish with your life. Within
                reason, whatever someone else has done, you can do as well. The very fact that you can set a clear goal
                for yourself means that you probably have the ability to achieve it. Nature does not give you a burning
                desire for something without also equipping you with the talents and abilities you need to acquire it.
                <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIf you think back over your life, you will recall that almost everything
                that you ever really wanted long enough and hard enough you finally achieved.You are not helpless, and
                you are not stuck in a rut. Your true potential is limited only by your own imagination and
                determination. <br><br>
            <li><b>OUR BIGGEST ENEMIES</b>
              <p> <br>The two factors that contribute most to the feeling of helplessness and the comfort zone are
                <i>fear</i> and <i>ignorance</i>. Fear is and always has been your greatest enemy. Fear and self-doubt
                do more to hold you back from dreaming big dreams, and accomplishing great things, than any other
                factors. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIt seems that the <i>less you know</i> about a subject, the
                <i>more fearful</i> you are of trying something new or different in that area.Your ignorance makes you
                reluctant to reach out for something better than what you are doing today. Fear and ignorance reinforce
                each other, growing until they induce in you a form of mental paralysis that leads inevitably to
                underachievement and failure. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspHere is a wonderful discovery. Aggressively
                learning about any subject builds your confidence and diminishes your fear in that area. As your
                knowledge or skill increases, you soon reach the point where you are ready to take action and make
                changes. But if you are completely ignorant in a particular area, if you have not read or learned
                anything about a subject, it will seem too difficult and may even appear overwhelming to you. Your lack
                of knowledge will make you afraid to take the actions necessary to improve your life in that area.
                <br><br>
            <li><b>NEUTRALIZING YOUR FEARS</b>
              <p> <br>The antidotes to fear and ignorance are <i>desire</i> and <i>knowledge.</i> The only real
                limitation on what you can accomplish is the level of intensity of your desire. If you really want
                something badly enough, there are almost no limits on what you can achieve. And the more you learn about
                any subject, the greater will be your desire to accomplish something in that area. As your knowledge
                grows, you become more confident in taking the necessary steps to make your goals a reality.
                <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAs you <i>increase</i> your levels of desire and knowledge, you
                <i>decrease</i> the self-limiting effects of fear and ignorance, and their companions, learned
                helplessness and the comfort zone. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWith desire and knowledge, you
                eventually replace fear and ignorance with <i>courage</i> and <i>confidence</i>.The more you learn about
                anything that is important to you, the more courage you will have to attempt to achieve it, and the more
                confident you will be that you can eventually succeed. As Henry Ford once said, ''If you believe you can
                do a thing, or you believe you cannot, in either case, you are probably right.'' <br><br>
            <li><b>YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE</b>
              <p> <br>My first big breakthrough in life came when I discovered that I could learn anything I needed to
                learn to achieve any goal I could set for myself. My second breakthrough was when I realized that I was
                completely responsible for myself and everything that happened to me. <i>No one was going to do anything
                  for me.</i> If I wanted something, it was completely up to me to do whatever was necessary to get it.
                If I had a problem or limitation, it was up to me to solve it or overcome it. I was on my own.
                <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe acceptance of <i>personal responsibility</i> for your life is the
                giant step from childhood to maturity. Prior to that decision, people criticize, complain, and blame
                others for their problems. After that decision, they see themselves as the primary creative forces in
                their own lives. Before you take total responsibility for your life, you see yourself as a
                <i>victim.</i> Afterward, you see yourself as a <i>victor</i>. <br><br>
            <li><b>ALL CAUSATION IS MENTAL</b>
              <p> <br>My third breakthrough came when I learned that <i>all causation is mental.</i> Everything you
                create in your material world begins with a thought of some kind. If you want to change something on the
                outside, you have to begin by changing it first on the inside.You have to change your thinking if you
                want to change your life. This is the greatest discovery of all. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYou
                create your world with the continuous stream of thoughts, feelings, and images passing through your own
                mind. You control and determine your future by the thoughts you think in the present. Nothing around you
                has any meaning except for the meaning you give it by the thoughts and emotions you attach to it. As
                Shakespeare wrote in Hamlet, ''There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.'' <br><br>
            <li><b>THE LAW OF BELIEF</b>
              <p> <br>Remember, <i>whatever you believe, with feeling, becomes your reality.</i>The greater the
                intensity of your belief, the more emotion you combine with it, the greater the impact it has on your
                behavior and on everything that happens to you. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIf you absolutely believe
                that you are destined to be a great success, and you hold to this belief no matter what happens, then
                there is nothing in the world that can stop you from becoming that great success. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                &nbsp &nbspIf you absolutely believe that you are a good person with tremendous abilities and that you
                are going to do remarkable things with your life, that belief will express itself through all of your
                actions and will eventually become your reality. The biggest responsibility you have to yourself is to
                change your beliefs on the inside so that they are consistent with the realities you wish to enjoy on
                the outside. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYou can always tell what your beliefs really are by looking
                at what you do. You always express your true values in your actions. You always act on the outside
                consistent with who you really are, and what you really believe, on the inside. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                &nbsp &nbspOne of the best ways to determine your true beliefs is to think about how you behave when you
                are angry, upset, or under pressure of any kind. This is when they come out. As Terrance wrote,
                <i>''Circumstances do not make the man; they only reveal him to himself.''</i> (And to others!)
                <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspBy using the Law of Reversibility, you can develop within yourself the
                values, beliefs, and qualities you most admire by acting as if you already had them, whenever they are
                called for by the circumstances of your life.To develop courage, force yourself to act courageously,
                even when you are afraid. To develop integrity, speak and act with complete honesty, even if you feel
                like shading the truth or cutting corners. Soon your beliefs will mirror your acts, and your acts will
                mirror your beliefs. <br><br>
            <li><b>THE LAW OF EXPECTATIONS</b>
              <p> <br>The Law of Expectations says that <i>whatever you expect, with confidence, becomes your own
                  self-fulfilling prophecy.</i>You are continually telling your own fortune when you talk about how you
                think things are going to turn out in a particular area.Your expectations then determine your attitude,
                and your attitude causes people to behave toward you in a way that reflects what you are thinking
                inside. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIf you expect to be successful, you will eventually be
                successful. If you expect to be happy and popular, you will be happy and popular. If you expect to be
                healthy and prosperous, admired and respected by the people around you, that is what will happen.
                <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYou can tell your true expectations by listening to the words you use to
                describe an upcoming event. Always think and talk positively about the future. Start every morning by
                saying; <i>''I believe something wonderful is going to happen to me today.''</i> Then, throughout the
                day, expect the best. Be open and alert to the possibility that each thing that happens, positive or
                negative, contains something good. You will be amazed at the effect this approach to life has on your
                attitude, and on the way you are treated by the people around you. <br><br>
            <li><b>POSITIVE SELF-EXPECTANCY</b>
              <p> <br>Successful, happy people continually maintain an attitude of positive self-expectancy. They expect
                to be successful in advance, and they are seldom disappointed. They expect to make more sales than they
                lose.They expect to learn something valuable from every experience. They expect to eventually achieve
                their goals, and they remain open to the possibility that those goals may be achieved in a way that they
                didn't expect. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe very best way to predict the future is to create it,
                and you create your future by the way you approach everything that happens to you today, either
                positively or negatively. If you approach each situation confidently expecting to learn from it or gain
                from it, you will continue to grow and progress and move toward your goals.You will also be a happier,
                more optimistic person that other people will want to be around and to help. <br><br>
            <li><b>THE LAW OF ATTRACTION</b>
              <p> <br>The Law of Attraction is considered by many people to be the most important law of all in
                explaining both success and failure. This law says that you are a ''living magnet'' and that you
                inevitably attract the people and circumstances into your life that harmonize with your dominant
                thoughts, especially those thoughts that you emotionalize strongly. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspBy
                this law, or natural force, the more you think about something you want, the more excited you will
                become about achieving it. The more excited or convinced you become, the more you will attract that goal
                into your life, like a magnet attracts iron filings.Your thoughts will create a force field of energy
                that will attract the people, circumstances, ideas, opportunities, and resources that you need to
                achieve your goals.When you change your thinking about yourself and your possibilities, you will attract
                into your life the forces necessary to turn those big thoughts and ideas into real-life experiences.
                <br><br>
            <li><b>THE LAW OF CORRESPONDENCE</b>
              <p> <br>This law says that <i>your outer world corresponds to your inner world,</i> that what you
                experience on the outside is a reflection of your inner world.Whatever you see when you look around you,
                you see something in yourself. <i>''Wherever you go, there you are.</i>''Your outer world of wealth,
                work, relationships, and health will mirror back to you the pictures and images that are going on inside
                you. Nothing can permanently stay in your life unless it corresponds with something within you.
                <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspTo have happier relationships, you must become a more loving person, not
                in thought alone, but genuinely, in your heart. As you become a more loving person on the inside, your
                outer world of relationships will change, and sometimes immediately. To become more financially
                prosperous on the outside, you must become more prosperous on the inside. To be healthier and fitter in
                your body, you must think like a healthy and fit person in your mind. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn
                1905, Dr.William James of Harvard said, ''The greatest revolution of my generation is the discovery that
                individuals, by changing their inner attitudes of mind, can change the outer aspects of their lives.''
                <br><br>
            <li><b>TAKE CHARGE OF YOUR LIFE</b>
              <p> <br>There is only one thing over which you have complete control, and that is the content of your own
                mind. Only you can decide what you are going to think, and how you are going to think about it. This
                power, this control, is all you need to create a wonderful life for yourself.Your ability to steer your
                thoughts toward a destination of your own choosing is sufficient to enable you to overcome all
                obstacles, and make up for all limitations, on your road to success. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe
                Laws of Belief, Expectations, Attraction, and Correspondence, used consciously and deliberately, are the
                keys to your accomplishing wonderful things with your life. When you begin to change your thinking about
                your goals and possibilities, your beliefs and actions will change.You will find yourself doing more and
                more of the things you need to do to make your dreams come true. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYou will
                continually expect good things to happen to you, and you will seldom be disappointed.You will begin
                attracting all kinds of wonderful people and opportunities into your life. Your whole world will begin
                to correspond, on the outside, with the wonderful goals and pictures that you are creating on the
                inside. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspSuccessful and happy people have a generally positive mental
                attitude. Prosperous and wealthy people have a prosperous and wealthy mind-set. Kind, patient, gentle,
                loving people, who enjoy happy and fulfilling relationships with their families and friends, have kind,
                patient, loving ways of thinking. When you develop the same mind-set that other successful people have,
                you will soon enjoy the same results and experiences that they do. <br><br>
            <li><b>START WHERE YOU ARE</b>
              <p> <br>You may think that you lack the education, opportunities, or resources that other successful
                people seem to have. Don't worry.The fact is that most people start off with few advantages. The story
                of most successful people is the story of people who started with nothing and did something worthwhile
                with their lives. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspI used to feel sorry for myself because I entered my
                twenties with no money and a limited education. Then I learned that most people start off with little or
                no money. If they do get a good education, most of it turns out to be largely useless in the real world
                once they get out of school. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThen I felt sorry for myself because I had
                no natural talents to help me, and I couldn't find a good job. I soon learned that most people start off
                in the same boat. Most people try and fail at a lot of things before they find the right situation for
                their talents and abilities. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe fact is that everything you ever achieve
                you are going to have to do <i>yourself.</i> No one is going to do it for you. But if you keep learning
                and growing, trying lots of things, you will eventually get the breaks. Everyone does. Just remember
                that opportunities are like a fumble in a football game. If you don't personally pick up the ball and
                run with it, it just lies there and has no effect on the score. When you get your chance, take action on
                it immediately. <br><br>
            <li><b>IT'S A WONDERFUL WORLD</b>
              <p> <br>We are living in a wonderful world today, probably the best period in all of human history.You are
                surrounded by more opportunities and possibilities to achieve your dreams than have ever existed before.
                There are no limits to what you can accomplish except for the limits that you put on yourself with your
                own thinking. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe feeling of learned helplessness and the lure of the
                comfort zone are the two major mental obstacles to changing your thinking, dreaming big dreams, and
                setting big goals for yourself. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe way to overcome fear and ignorance is
                with desire and knowledge. The two qualities that flow out of intense desire and increased knowledge are
                the courage and the confidence you need to do whatever is necessary to achieve anything you really want.
                <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYou translate your dreams into concrete realities by turning them into
                goals.You decide exactly what you want, write it down, set a deadline, and determine the efforts you are
                going to have to make to achieve it. Make written plans of action to achieve your goal and then do
                something every day to move toward it. Resolve in advance that you will never, ever give up. <br><br>
            <li><b>MAKE PROGRESS, NOT EXCUSES</b>
              <p> <br>Mark Twain once wrote, <i>''There are a thousand excuses for failure, but never a good
                  reason.''</i> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen I stopped making excuses, I started making progress.
                When I stopped blaming other people and feeling sorry for myself, I began thinking about specific
                actions I could take to improve my situation. When I began to set goals and make plans for their
                accomplishment, I felt in control of my life and my future.When I began learning what I needed to know
                to achieve my goals, I felt more confident and competent in other parts of my life as well. And as I
                began achieving my goals, one by one, just as you will achieve yours, my thinking changed completely.
                <br><br>
            <li><b>CHANGING YOUR LIFE</b>
              <p> <br>Success is an inside job. It is a state of mind. It begins within you and is soon reflected in the
                world around you. When you change your thinking for the better, you become a better person. By dreaming
                big dreams and envisioning an exciting future, you become a leader. By writing down your goals and
                making plans to accomplish them, you take full control of your life. And by practicing the ideas taught
                in this book, you can and will become <i>unstoppable.</i> <br><br><b>ACTION EXERCISES</b>
              <ol> <br><br>
                <li>Resolve today to accept 100 percent responsibility for everything you are or will ever be. Instead
                  of making excuses, decide to make progress. <br><br>
                <li>Identify one area where you use the words ''I can't'' when you think of the need to change or do
                  something different. Now imagine that your limitations in that area are all in your mind. <br><br>
                <li>In what parts of your life have you become comfortable, so much so that you resist change, even if
                  it would be an improvement? What could you do to get out of this comfort zone? <br><br>
                <li>Identify one area where fear and doubt are holding you back from doing something that you want to
                  do. Imagine that you were absolutely guaranteed success in that area.What would you do differently?
                  <br><br>
                <li>What are your favorite excuses for not making the decisions or taking the actions you need to if you
                  want to achieve all your goals? What if your excuses were not true? <br><br>
                <li>Desire and knowledge are the antidotes to fear and doubt.What could you do immediately to increase
                  your knowledge in an area where you want to take action? <br><br>
                <li>Identify one key area of your life that you have created with your own thinking. How could you

                  <p> <br><br>The starting point of great accomplishment is for you to break loose from the mental bonds
                    that hold you back. Dreaming big dreams and setting big goals provide the starting point of
                    thinking, seeing, and feeling yourself to be capable of achieving far more than you ever have
                    before. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspHow you think and feel about yourself is largely determined
                    by how <i>effective</i> you feel you are in the important things you do, especially in your work or
                    career. It is not possible for you to feel happy and confident as a person if you are not competent
                    and capable in the areas of your life that are central to your personal identity. <br><br>&nbsp
                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOne of the most powerful ways for you to change your thinking about yourself is for
                    you to <i>commit to excellence.</i> It is to make the decision, right now, to be the best, to join
                    the top 10 percent in your field, no matter how long it takes. The very act of thinking of yourself
                    as <i>potentially</i> excellent at what you do actually changes your mind-set and improves your
                    personality. It makes you happier and raises your self-esteem.You like and respect yourself more,

                <li><b>THE GOOD OLD DAYS</b>
                  <p> <br>At one time, you had to be excellent to rise to the top of your field or market. Today,
                    however, excellence is taken for granted. Today, you have to be excellent just to get into the
                    market in the first place.Then you have to constantly improve, getting better and better, week by
                    week and month by month, if you want to keep up with the competition. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                    &nbspIn every field, the top 20 percent of companies make 80 percent of the profits in that business
                    or industry. The top 20 percent of salespeople make 80 percent of the sales and 80 percent of the
                    income. The top 20 percent in every field enjoy most of the great rewards of money, pride,
                    satisfaction, and reputation that go along with being the best at what they do. Your job is to join
                    them, as quickly as possible. <br><br>
                <li><b>THE CONTROL VALVE ON PERFORMANCE</b>
                  <p> <br>Perhaps the most important quality of high-achieving men and women is that of <i>ambition.</i>
                    They see themselves, think about themselves, and conduct themselves every day as though they were
                    among the elite in their fields. They set high goals for themselves and continually work to exceed
                    those goals. For them quotas are minimums, not maximums. They look upon the accomplishments of
                    everyone else as challenges to themselves to be even better. And so must you. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                    &nbsp &nbspThe core of your personality is your level of <i>self-esteem</i>.Your selfesteem is a
                    measure of how much you value yourself, and how much you think of yourself as an important and
                    worthwhile person. Your self-esteem is the power source of your personality. It determines your
                    levels of energy, enthusiasm, motivation, inspiration, and drive.The more you like and respect
                    yourself, the better you do at everything you attempt. And the better you do, the more you like and
                    respect yourself. Self-esteem and personal excellence reinforce each other. <br><br>
                <li><b>THE BETTER YOU DO</b>
                  <p> <br><i>Self-esteem</i> and <i>self-efficacy</i> are flip sides of the same coin of personality.
                    You can genuinely like and respect yourself only when you know, deep in your heart, that you are
                    really good at what you do. A sense of <i>personal mastery</i> is absolutely essential to the
                    healthy human personality. Every single thing that you do in an excellent fashion boosts your
                    self-esteem and makes you feel better about yourself. It makes you feel even more confident of
                    performing at even higher levels. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAchieving your full potential
                    requires high levels of courage and confidence. Great success requires a continual willingness to
                    move out of your comfort zone, and to break the bonds of learned helplessness that hold most people
                    back. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe higher your self-esteem, the more powerful, positive, and
                    determined you will become. The more you like yourself, the more willing you will be to take
                    chances, to step out in faith, and to persist longer than anyone else. The better you become in your
                    chosen field, the stronger and more confident you will become in every other part of your life as
                    well. <br><br>
                <li><b>THE ABSOLUTE PREREQUISITE</b>
                  <p> <br>The fact is that it is impossible for you to be truly happy or successful until you know in
                    your heart that you are very, very good at what you do. For this reason alone, you must resolve to
                    overcome any obstacle, pay any price, and go any distance to achieve this level of excellence.You
                    must set a goal to be among the top 10 percent of performers in your field, and then do whatever it
                    takes to get there. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspFortunately, getting to the top is easier than
                    you think. The great majority of people seldom think about personal excellence. And if the thought
                    crosses their minds, they quickly dismiss it and go back to average performance. Most of the people
                    around you are content to do their jobs, for better or for worse, and then go out with their
                    friends, or go home and watch television. However, when you begin to make those extra efforts that
                    enable you to excel, you will find that, like a runner going into a sprint, you soon move ahead of
                    the pack of the average performers. <br><br>
                <li><b>DEVELOP THE WINNING EDGE</b>
                  <p> <br>One of the most important of all success principles is the ''winning edge'' concept. This
                    concept explains success and failure, and has been demonstrated over and over. This principle says:
                    <i>Small differences in ability can lead to enormous differences in results.</i> It seems that the
                    top people in every field are usually just a little bit better than the average in the critical
                    things that they do. But consistency in being a little bit better in your key skill areas eventually
                    adds up to an enormous difference in results. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn fact, all you need
                    is to be about 3 percent better in each of the key result areas of your job to develop the winning
                    edge. This edge enables you to move to the front in the race of life. Once you get a little ahead,
                    you can then maintain and increase this gap by continuous self-improvement.You can continue to get
                    better and better with learning and practice.With this strategy, you will soon emerge in the top 10
                    percent, or even the top 5 percent, of people in your field. <br><br>
                <li><b>KEY RESULT AREAS</b>
                  <p> <br>Success in any job requires a minimum level of performance in one or more tasks or functions.
                    These are the key result areas (KRAs) of the position. Key results areas are the tasks that you
                    absolutely, positively have to do well to be successful in your overall job, whatever it is. As it
                    happens, there are seldom more than five to seven key result areas in any job, position, company, or
                    area of responsibility. Your job is to identify the KRAs of your job and then make a plan to improve
                    in each one. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe reason they are called ''key result areas'' is
                    because they are the essential skills necessary for you to do your job completely and well. A
                    weakness in any one of them can hold you back from excellent performance in your overall job.You are
                    successful because of your strength in certain key result areas, but your weakest key result area
                    determines the degree of effectiveness with which you will be able to use all the others.Your
                    weakest key skill area largely determines your income. <br><br>
                <li><b>IDENTIFY YOUR KEY SKILLS</b>
                  <p> <br>Each job or desired result can be defined in terms of the key skills necessary to achieve it.
                    For example, there are seven key result areas in selling. A weakness in any one of them can hold you
                    back from selling as much as you can. They are: (1) prospecting; (2) establishing trust and rapport;
                    (3) identifying the customer's problem or need; (4) presenting your product or service as the ideal
                    solution to the problem; (5) answering objections and concerns; (6) getting agreement to proceed;
                    and (7) obtaining resales and referrals. If you perform well in all seven of these areas, you will
                    soon be at the top of your field. If you are poor in any area, your performance in that area will
                    determine your income. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn management, there are also seven key result
                    areas. They are: (1) planning; (2) organizing; (3) selecting the right people; (4) delegating; (5)
                    supervising; (6) measuring; and (7) reporting, both upward and downward. If you are excellent at
                    every key skill except for one, that one weakness alone will hold you back in your career as a
                    manager. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThere are critical success factors in almost every area of
                    life. For example, there are four critical success factors that determine your physical health. They
                    are: (1) proper diet; (2) proper weight; (3) proper exercise; and (4) proper rest. Almost all of
                    your health problems can be traced back to a problem or deficiency in one of these four areas.
                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe starting point of personal excellence is for you to identify the
                    key result areas of your job. Define them clearly and write them down. Make a list of the tasks, in
                    order, that you must perform to get the results expected of you in your job. Evaluate your current
                    performance in each of these key result areas.Where are you strong? Where are you weak? Be honest.
                    <br><br>
                <li><b>SET STANDARDS OF PERFORMANCE</b>
                  <p> <br>If you want to lose weight, the first thing you do is weigh yourself. If you want to improve
                    in any area, you first measure how well you are doing in that area today, and then use that as a
                    baseline for improvement. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOnce you have determined the results that
                    you absolutely, positively have to get to perform at your best in a particular aspect area of your
                    life or work, you then give yourself a score of 1 to 10 in each key result area, with 1 being the
                    lowest and 10 being the highest. You must be at a 7 level or above in each area to do your overall
                    job in an excellent fashion. Wherever you are scoring 7 or below, you must set a goal to improve in
                    that area. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAlways start your program of personal improvement where
                    you can get the greatest result the fastest.This will invariably be in the key result area where you
                    are the weakest. Identify your lowest-scoring KRA and then make a plan to improve in this skill area
                    as quickly as possible. Simultaneously, you develop a plan to gradually improve in each other area
                    where you are weak. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspEvery step you take toward improving yourself in
                    one of your key result areas will improve your results in your job. The better you get at your job,
                    the more you will like and respect yourself. The more you like and respect yourself, the better you
                    will feel, and the more energy and enthusiasm you will have.You will soon become unstoppable.
                    <br><br>
                <li><b>PERSONAL STRATEGIC PLANNING</b>
                  <p> <br>In the business world of the twentieth century, it was generally agreed that corporations
                    should conduct strategic planning on a regular basis. Individuals, though, were encouraged to set
                    personal goals. In the twenty-first century, however, the situation is different. Today, each
                    individual, just like a company, must engage in a regular process of personal strategic planning.
                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn personal strategic planning, you view yourself as a business
                    organization. With this perspective, you make more detailed, longrange plans for your goals and
                    activities in every part of your life. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspToday, you must spend far more
                    time thinking about your future than ever before.You must invest more energy and effort analyzing
                    and planning the steps you need to take to translate your future dreams into present realities.You
                    must manage yourself better than ever before.You have to take complete control over everything that
                    happens to you. <br><br>
                <li><b>AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION</b>
                  <p> <br>Sometimes I ask my audiences, ''How many people here are selfemployed?'' Usually, about 10 to
                    15 percent of the audience will raise their hands. I then stop the seminar and ask them again, ''How
                    many people here are really self-employed?'' And then I wait. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIt
                    doesn't take them very long. People look at each other and then back at me and then at each other
                    again. Soon, one hand after another begins to go up. Eventually, everyone has his or her hands
                    raised. Everyone realizes that they are all self-employed. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp<i>The
                      biggest mistake that you can make is to think that you ever work for anyone else but yourself.</i>
                    The fact is that you are always selfemployed, from the time you take your first job until the time
                    you retire. No matter who signs your paycheck, you are working for <i>yourself.</i> You are the
                    president of an entrepreneurial personal services company with one employee - <i>yourself</i>. In
                    the long run, as a result of the things that you do or fail to do, you determine how much you earn.
                    If you want an increase in pay, you can go to the nearest mirror and negotiate with your ''boss.''
                    <br><br>
                <li><b>YOU DETERMINE YOUR OWN INCOME</b>
                  <p> <br>People sometimes argue with me about this. They say that the pay structures in their business
                    or industry are determined by factors over which they have no control. But then I point out to them
                    that it was they who decided to go to work in that business or industry. And it is they who decide
                    to stay there.They are in charge.They are on their own payroll. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIf
                    you are not happy with any part of your work, it is up to you to change it. Benjamin Disraeli said,
                    ''Never complain and never explain.'' If there is a part of your work or personal life that you
                    don't like, don't waste your time complaining about it. Instead, take action. As Shakespeare's
                    Hamlet expresses it, ''take arms against a sea of troubles, and by opposing end them.''
                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspSeeing yourself as the president of your own personal services
                    corporation requires that you accept total responsibility for everything you are, and everything you
                    ever will be. This is an enormous thought for many people. It is both scary and exhilarating.
                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspJust imagine! You are where you are and what you are because you have
                    decided to be there. Everything you accomplish, for the rest of your life, will be largely
                    determined by the actions that you take, or fail to take.You are responsible.You are in charge.You
                    are in control.You are your own boss. And there are no limits except the limits that you allow the
                    outside world to place on yourself and on your thinking. <br><br>
                <li><b>THE AIM OF STRATEGY</b>
                  <p> <br>When you begin thinking of yourself as a <i>personal services corporation</i>, you separate
                    yourself from all those people who think they work for someone else. When you take charge of your
                    career, you begin thinking in terms of personal strategic planning, just like a large business.You
                    begin making plans for the long term. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe parallels between corporate
                    planning and personal planning are very similar. The purpose of strategic planning in a business is
                    to achieve the highest <i>return on equity</i> (ROE) invested in the business. All strategic plans
                    and tactics are aimed at reorganizing the resources and activities of the company in such a way that
                    it achieves a higher rate of financial return on its resources than it was achieving before.
                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn its simplest terms, strategic planning is aimed at increasing the
                    ratio of outputs to inputs. All of the management practices popular today, such as <i>restructuring,
                      reorganizing, reengineering, and reinventing,</i> are aimed at improving the functioning of the
                    organization so that it earns more money. They are aimed at increasing outputs and rates of return
                    on equity. <br><br>
                <li><b>INCREASING YOUR RETURN ON ENERGY</b>
                  <p> <br>If return on financial capital is called return on equity, your personal ROE is your <i>return
                      on energy.</i> Personal strategic planning is focused on organizing and reorganizing your life,
                    restructuring and reengineering your activities, to increase the quality and quantity of rewards you
                    get from the investment of the hours and days of your life in what you do. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                    &nbspLet us say, for example, that you have decided that you want to double your income in the next
                    three to five years. This is a reasonable goal that many people around you are already achieving. It
                    is not that difficult to achieve. Simply put, to double your income, you merely have to double the
                    value of your output relative to your input. You have to double the value of your contribution.
                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspFinancial results come as the result of performing a function or
                    producing valuable goods and services that someone is willing to pay for. If you want to increase
                    the amount you get out, you have to make a plan to increase the amount you put in. <br><br>
                <li><b>YOUR AREA OF EXCELLENCE</b>
                  <p> <br>What is the critical factor that determines the success or failure of any company? It is its
                    <i>competitive advantage</i>, or ''area of excellence.'' Every company comes into being and survives
                    because it has a unique capacity to offer the market something that is better in some way than
                    anything being offered by its competitors. It stays in business as long as it continues to satisfy
                    its customers in a particular area better than anyone else. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe
                    competitive advantage or <i>unique selling proposition</i> of a company determines its rate of
                    growth, its level of sales, its profitability, and its very survival. Companies without a
                    competitive advantage soon disappear from the marketplace, to be replaced by other companies with
                    clear, unmistakable, competitive advantages that customers can and will pay for. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                    &nbsp &nbspYou are no different. As the president of a company of one, you, too, must develop and
                    maintain meaningful competitive advantage. You must develop an area of uniqueness.You must be
                    absolutely excellent in the work that you do so that you can rise to the top of your field.Your
                    choices and decisions about what your competitive advantage is, and will be, are the critical
                    determinants of your financial success in your life and career. <br><br>
                <li><b>SUCCEEDING THE HARD WAY</b>
                  <p> <br>Some years ago, a friend of mine went to work for a stock brokerage firm. The recruiting and
                    training program was highly technical and the sales training was virtually nonexistent. When he
                    finally got his brokerage license, he was given the yellow pages and told to begin ''dialing for
                    dollars,'' phoning anybody he could get on the other end of the line and pitching them on his
                    products. He soon learned that this was one of the hardest ways in the world to crack the
                    professional sales field and make a living. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOne day he had a sudden
                    insight that changed his career, and eventually made him one of the top financial advisers in the
                    country. He realized that his entire career, and everything that happened to him - his family
                    lifestyle, his bank account, and his future— would be determined by how good he was on the
                    telephone. So he made a decision to become absolutely outstanding at using the telephone as a
                    prospecting and selling tool. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspHe read every book he could find on
                    effective telephone techniques. He took every course and studied every piece of information on the
                    subject. He became so good at using the telephone that he could recognize 19 different kinds of
                    hesitancy in the voice of the person he was calling. He developed appropriate responses to each one
                    so that he could reassure his prospects and clients that what he was recommending was the right
                    thing for them. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspToday, he earns more than five million dollars per
                    year buying and selling investments for his clients over the phone on straight commission. Fully 99
                    percent of his business is done by telephone and now by computer, e-mail, and fax. He seldom meets
                    his clients personally. But on the phone, he is a master communicator. He definitely and
                    specifically identified and developed a competitive advantage that he used to move to the top of his
                    field.What could it be for you? <br><br>

                  <p> <br>Here is an exercise: Complete this sentence: ''If I could ______ really well, I could make all
                    the money I wanted.''Your job is to fill in the blank. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp<i>What one
                      skill, if you developed and did it consistently in an excellent fashion, would have the greatest
                      positive impact on your income?</i> If you could wave a magic wand and be absolutely outstanding
                    in any one part of your work, which part of your work would you choose? Whatever your answer, this
                    is the key result area that you need to begin work on right away. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAll
                    lasting success in your business or career will come as a result of your doing something extremely
                    well, something that others value and are willing to pay for. And anything that anyone else can do
                    in an excellent fashion, you can learn to do as well. Remember, everyone in the top 10 percent
                    started in the bottom 10 percent. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspEveryone who is doing well today
                    was once doing poorly. All of the people at the top of your field were at one time in some other
                    field altogether.The way to get to the front of the buffet line of life, where all the good things
                    are to be found, is simple. First, <i>get in line</i>. Make a decision to join the top 10 percent,
                    no matter how long it takes. Second, <i>stay in line</i>. Once you start moving toward personal
                    excellence, keep learning and practicing until you get there. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspHere's
                    the good news. The buffet line of life is moving! It never closes. It is open 24 hours per day.
                    Everyone who gets in line and stays in line eventually gets to the front. Nothing can stop you from
                    getting into the top 10 percent except yourself.You are responsible. <br><br>
                <li><b>CLARIFY YOUR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE</b>
                  <p> <br>One of the first questions you ask of yourself is, <i>''What is my competitive
                      advantage?''</i>What are you absolutely excellent at doing? What is it that you do better than
                    almost anyone else in your business? What unique set of skills do you have that accounts for most of
                    your success to date? Where are you really good? <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYour second question
                    is, ''Looking at the trends in my industry, what will my competitive advantage be in three to five
                    years?'' If things continue on the way they are and you could project yourself three to five years
                    into the future and look around, what will you need to be doing in an excellent fashion at that
                    time? <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspMany people have trouble answering both of these questions.
                    They are not sure what their competitive advantage is today, and as a result they have no idea what
                    their competitive advantage will be in the future. If you are in this situation, you are in great
                    danger of underachieving and even failing in your career. <br><br>
                <li><b>YOUR POTENTIAL COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE</b>
                  <p> <br>Here is the next question: ''What should your competitive advantage be?'' If you could be
                    absolutely outstanding in any one area, what should it be? If you're not sure, go and ask your boss
                    or your co-workers. Ask them, <i>''If I was really, really good in any one skill, what one skill
                      would have the greatest positive impact on my results?''</i> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYou
                    usually know the answer to this question as soon as you ask it. If you are in doubt about the one
                    skill that could help you the most, ask for advice and input from others.The people around you,
                    especially your boss, can usually tell you quite quickly the answer to this question. <br><br>&nbsp
                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOnce you have the answer, you set the development of that skill as your new goal or
                    target to aim at.You change your thinking in a very positive way in that area, and you begin to
                    imagine that you have the ability to be absolutely outstanding in that one area.You write it down,
                    set a deadline, make a plan, and go to work on improving yourself in that area. In no time at all,
                    you will begin to develop the winning edge in your job that will enable you to move ahead of the
                    crowd. <br><br>
                <li><b>FIRE THE STAFF</b>
                  <p> <br>Some companies today are taking their people through an exercise that can be quite traumatic
                    to their employees. They call everyone together, and then they fire the entire staff.They announce
                    that they are going to be rehiring someone for each job, and that each person can reapply for their
                    job as though they were outside contractors presenting a proposal. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                    &nbspThis proposal for their jobs would include a description of what they intend to do, how they
                    intend to do it, how much they would charge for their work, and how much the company would gain or
                    save by paying them the salaries they are requesting for what they are proposing to do.
                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAs you can imagine, many employees are completely baffled when they
                    are confronted with this exercise. The very idea of thinking through their current jobs and
                    describing them in the form of a business proposal, along with a justification for why they should
                    be paid the amount that they are asking, is an overwhelming task. Most people have never thought
                    about their jobs in this way before. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspFinally, the boss adds one more
                    detail. He tells them that they will each be competing against other people who will also be
                    submitting proposals for the same jobs. Whoever offers the company the best deal or price will get
                    the position. <br><br>
                <li><b>DETERMINE EXACTLY WHAT YOU DO</b>
                  <p> <br>If you were put into this position and you had to write out a proposal for your job, starting
                    with the most important and valuable things that you do for your company, how would you explain
                    yourself? How would you sell yourself to your current employer? How would make a case for the kind
                    of money you want to earn? <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhat are your core competencies? What
                    special talents and abilities do you have that make you valuable and set you apart from others? What
                    should your core competencies be, or what could they be in the future? What is it that you do in
                    such an excellent fashion that you are worth the kind of money that you want to earn? Your answers
                    to these questions are essential to your success in your career. <br><br>
                <li><b>HOW GOOD ARE YOU?</b>
                  <p> <br>There is a simple way to determine how good you are at what you do: <i>Are you in great
                      demand?</i> If you are very good, people are continually trying to hire you away from your current
                    employment. You receive regular job offers. If you are self-employed, you have more business than
                    you can handle.You get a steady flow of recommendations and referrals from satisfied customers.
                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen you are in demand, you have complete job security.You know that
                    if something happened to your current job, you could walk across the street and get another job
                    tomorrow. You never worry about the ups or downs in the economy because you always have far more
                    opportunities than you can handle in a 24-hour day. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen you reach
                    this point, you will know that you are one of the very best in your field.You will feel terrific
                    about yourself.You will have complete control over your future. <br><br>
                <li><b>DO WHAT YOU LOVE TO DO</b>
                  <p> <br>You may be wondering how you go about determining your area of excellence, if you don't
                    already have one. If you are already very good at what you do, you should know that with change
                    taking place so rapidly in your field, within a few years you will probably find yourself in another
                    job, doing something different, with a different area of excellence.Whatever got you to where you
                    are today is not enough to keep you there. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspHere is one of the most
                    important parts of changing your thinking. <i>Successful people do what they love to do.</i> They do
                    their jobs for the art and joy of it.They would do what they are doing even if they weren't being
                    paid for it. Ask yourself this question: <i>''What would I choose to work at if I was financially
                      independent and could do anything I wanted?''</i> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspHow would you
                    change your life if you won a million dollars? The great majority of people, if they won a million
                    dollars, would immediately quit their current jobs. If you would quit your current job if you won a
                    million dollars, this is a danger signal. It means that you are in great danger of wasting your
                    career and wasting your life. <br><br>
                <li><b>DETERMINE WHAT YOU ENJOY DOING</b>
                  <p> <br>Self-made millionaires almost invariably say that their secret of success was that they found
                    out what they enjoyed doing, and they did it with their whole heart. Most successful people feel
                    that they don't really work at all. Some of them say, ''I haven't worked a day in my life.'' Their
                    work and their play are intermingled. They don't know where one begins and the other ends. When they
                    are not at work, they think about it and talk about it. And when they are at work, they lose
                    themselves in it. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThere are more than 22,000 official job categories
                    in the United States alone. Among these 22,000 categories, there are subcategories that bring the
                    number to easily 100,000 different jobs that you could be doing. And most of the jobs that people
                    will be doing in the twenty-first century have not even been invented yet. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                    &nbspOf the many thousands of jobs that exist, there are numerous jobs at which you could work and
                    earn an excellent living.Your goal must be to select the ideal job for you, the one that gives you
                    the greatest joy, satisfaction, and rewards, and then channel all of your energies into becoming
                    absolutely excellent in that one area. <br><br>
                <li><b>SUCCESS LEAVES TRACKS</b>
                  <p> <br>The starting point of identifying your special talents and unique abilities is for you to
                    think back into your past.What sorts of activities have given you your greatest results and rewards?
                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen you were in school, what subjects interested you the most? What
                    subjects did you get the best grades in? You will always be best at doing something that fascinates
                    you, that holds your attention, that captures your interest, and that you are naturally attracted
                    toward. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOne of the tests for whether something is right for you is
                    your desire to learn more about it.You will enjoy reading about it, talking about it, and learning
                    about it. Not only that, but you will naturally admire the people who are the most successful in the
                    field for which you are ideally suited. <br><br>
                <li><b>GO BACK TO YOUR CHILDHOOD</b>
                  <p> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOne way to determine your future is to examine your past. Look back
                    to what you most enjoyed doing when you were between the ages of 7 and 14 years old. At that time,
                    you were completely free to pursue any subject that attracted you.What did you most enjoy doing? If
                    you don't remember, go and ask one of your parents. They will usually remember how you spent your
                    time when you were younger. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspA participant in one of my seminars told
                    me that this principle applied to him exactly. When he was between the ages of 7 and 14, he loved to
                    build model airplanes. He spent many hours, long into the night, building more and more complex
                    models. Soon, he was building model planes with small engines and entering them in contests. As he
                    grew older, he built larger planes, remote-controlled, and flew them in competitions around the
                    country. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen he finished high school, he attended university and
                    earned a degree in aeronautical engineering. He now owns three companies. In one company, he designs
                    small aircraft. In a second company he leases and charters aircraft, and he owns a third company
                    that does aircraft maintenance. He told me that he was worth several million dollars and he felt
                    that he had never done a day's work in his life. He was still doing what he most enjoyed doing when
                    he was a young man. And he was only 35 years old. <br><br>
                <li><b>YOUR FEELING OF IMPORTANCE</b>
                  <p> <br>Dale Carnegie once wrote, ''Tell me what gives a person his greatest feeling of importance and
                    I will tell you his entire philosophy of life.''What gives you your greatest feeling of importance?
                    What gives you a heightened sense of self-esteem when you do it successfully? What do you most enjoy
                    doing, so much so that you are drawn back to it continuously? <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                    &nbspNapoleon Hill once said that one of the great secrets of success is to <i>decide what it is
                      that you most enjoy doing, and then find a way to earn a good living at it.</i> Most people get it
                    backward. They do what they feel they <i>have to do so</i> that they can finally acquire the time
                    and money necessary to do what they really <i>want to do.</i>Your goal should be to reverse this
                    order.You should do what you really enjoy doing from the very beginning. In this way, you will get
                    better and better doing more and more of the things that give you your greatest feeling of
                    importance. <br><br>
                <li><b>FACE THE FACTS</b>
                  <p> <br>One of the most important parts of changing your thinking is the development of the quality of
                    courage. I will discuss this subject in greater detail later, in Chapter 12. For the moment, in
                    terms of doing what you love to do, you need courage to face the fact that, right now, you might not
                    be in the right job, place, or relationship for you.You may be on the wrong path. <br><br>&nbsp
                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbspMost people back into their jobs and their careers, and even their relationships,
                    like backing up their car and hitting something, and then getting out to see what it was. They do
                    not have clear goals, so they accept whatever happens to them. They take the job that is offered to
                    them at the time they are starting work or making the transition from one job to another. They do
                    the work that is assigned to them. They allow their boss to determine their career path.
                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspTheir entire work lives soon become organized around the expectations
                    of the people who sign their paychecks. If they are not careful, years will go by and they will
                    completely lose sight of the child in them who started off in life with hopes and dreams, entering a
                    world of untapped possibilities and potentialities. <br><br>
                <li><b>BE TRUE TO YOURSELF</b>
                  <p> <br>Joseph Campbell, the late professor of mythology, told a story on the Bill Moyers Special
                    television show some years ago. It took place in a small local restaurant that he patronized with
                    his wife. One day another couple, along with their young son, came in and sat down for dinner at a
                    nearby table. Halfway through the meal, the boy spoke up and said that he didn't like his dinner,
                    and he wasn't going to eat it.The father became extremely angry and insisted that he eat it whether
                    he liked it or not. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe boy refused and said to his father, ''But I
                    don't want to eat it!'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAt this, the father blew up and shouted,
                    ''You don't want to? What does that have to do with anything? I never did anything I wanted to do in
                    my whole life!'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspCampbell went on to point out that many people are
                    in that same situation. Many people feel that they have lived their whole lives doing things that
                    other people wanted them to do because they never had the courage to do just what they wanted.
                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspCampbell then said that the key to success and happiness in life was
                    to ''follow your bliss.'' It was to do what you most loved to do. It was to look over the landscape
                    of your life and determine those activities that you enjoyed doing more than anything else, the
                    things that you would do if you had no limitations, and then to build your life around those
                    activities. <br><br>
                <li><b>BE PREPARED TO WALK AWAY</b>
                  <p> <br>Many of the happiest men and women in our society today are those who, at a certain point, got
                    up and walked away from a situation that they finally realized was not making them happy or
                    fulfilled. They had the courage to decide that they were going to do what they loved to do, rather
                    than what they felt they had to do. They looked deep within themselves and honestly assessed their
                    own natural talents and abilities. This often changed their whole lives. <br><br>
                <li><b>LISTEN TO OTHERS</b>
                  <p> <br>Some years ago, I began thinking in earnest about what it was that I really wanted to do. My
                    current job was coming to an end, and the prospects for the future, because of the economy, were not
                    very encouraging. Meanwhile, although I had a very good idea of what I wanted to do, I wasn't sure.
                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAt this point, I suddenly asked a friend of mine what he thought I
                    would be good at doing. He replied, without a moment's hesitation, ''You'd be excellent at teaching
                    and giving seminars.'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThat turned out to be exactly what I had been
                    thinking, but I was nervous about directing my whole career into a completely unknown field. My
                    friend's comment made me realize that often the people around you can see clearly what you should be
                    doing, even if you can't see it yourself. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIf you are at all unsure
                    about your area of natural talent and ability, ask someone who knows you well what he or she thinks
                    your ideal line of work would be. The people who know you and care about you will often give you
                    ideas and insights that change your whole life. Often these insights will reveal to you your heart's
                    desire. <br><br>
                <li><b>YOUR HEART'S DESIRE</b>
                  <p> <br>Your heart's desire is that one special thing that you were put on this earth to do. No one
                    else can do it in the same way that you can. It is something that may have been calling to you for
                    many years, like the sound of distant music. It is something that has interested you and attracted
                    you since you were young. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspPerhaps you have never told anyone about
                    it. Perhaps, deep in your heart, you were afraid of the enormous changes you would have to make to
                    pursue your heart's desire. But the fact is that you will never be truly happy or satisfied until
                    you let yourself go and throw your whole heart into whatever it is. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                    &nbspEric Butterworth wrote in his book Discover the Power within You (Harper & Row, 1968), <i>''You
                      are not what you are; you are what you can be.''</i> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspImagine! You
                    are not what you are, but rather, you are what you can be when you discover and develop your natural
                    talents and abilities to the full. <br><br>
                <li><b>BE HONEST WITH YOURSELF</b>
                  <p> <br>One of the marks of personal leadership is that you see yourself as you really are.You are
                    completely honest.You recognize and accept that you are completely responsible, the president of
                    your own personal services corporation.You accept that excellent rewards come only from excellent
                    performance in your chosen field. You view yourself strategically, as if you were looking at someone
                    else. You plan every part of your life, knowing that no one is going to do it for you. Especially,
                    you establish your own program for personal and professional improvement to assure that you become
                    one of the very best people in your field. <br><br>
                <li><b>THINK AND PLAN STRATEGICALLY</b>
                  <p> <br>There are several concepts in personal strategic planning that can improve your results and
                    change your life. As in everything, these are ways of thinking that lead to ways of acting more
                    effectively. <br><br>
                <li><b>DRAW A LINE</b>
                  <p> <br>The first concept is what I call ''zero-based thinking.'' Call a timeout in your life and
                    work. Draw a line under all your current activities. Now, imagine that you are starting over. Ask
                    yourself, <i>''Is there anything in my life that, knowing what I now know, I would not get into or
                      start up again today if I had it to do over?''</i> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThis is one of
                    the most important questions you will ever ask and answer.You can apply it on a ''go forward'' basis
                    to each part of your life. Often the biggest problem in personal strategic planning is your
                    attempting to make something work that you wouldn't even get into in the first place if you had to
                    do it over again. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOften when I consult with companies, they ask me
                    for advice on how to increase sales of a particular product or service. I always ask them,
                    <i>''Knowing what you now know, would you introduce this product or service again today if you had
                      it to do over?''</i> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThey often tell me that, knowing what they now
                    know, they would never have brought it out in the first place. My advice to them is always the same:
                    ''Kill it.'' One of the smartest things a company can do with a part of the business that is not
                    working, and which has no future, is to discontinue it as quickly as possible. This applies to
                    products, services, processes, methods of sale or advertising, investments, or any other area of
                    activity that consumes time, money, or emotional energy. <br><br>
                <li><b>HOLD YOUR OWN FEET TO THE FIRE</b>
                  <p> <br>If there is anything in your life or your work that you wouldn't get into today, knowing what
                    you now know, it is an excellent candidate for creative abandonment, for being discontinued
                    altogether. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIs there any relationship in your life - personal or
                    business - that, knowing what you now know, you wouldn't get into today if you had it to do over? If
                    there is, your next question is, <i>''How do I get out of this relationship, and how fast?''</i>
                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThink about your business and your career. Is there anything in your
                    work life that you wouldn't get into again today, knowing what you now know? Is there any business
                    process, procedure, activity, or expense that you wouldn't start again today if you had it to do
                    over? <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspFinally, think about your investments, not only of money, but
                    also of time or emotion. Is there any part of your life that is dragging you down, causing you
                    tension or stress, that you wouldn't get into again today if you were starting over? Sometimes, the
                    fastest way to change your thinking and your life is simply to question everything you are doing
                    today that is making you unhappy. If it is not working, abandon it and do something else. <br><br>
                <li><b>YOUR MOST VALUABLE ASSET</b>
                  <p> <br>Your most valuable asset is your time. It is also your scarcest resource. You have a limited
                    amount of time, and once it is gone, it is gone forever. Time is essential to accomplishment. Time
                    is perishable. You cannot get more of it, no matter what you do. It can be said that the quality of
                    your life is determined by the way you spend this precious resource. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                    &nbspResults and rewards, however you define them for yourself, are everything.Your ability to
                    achieve the health, happiness, and prosperity you desire is the measure of your effectiveness as a
                    human being.Your job is to use your minutes and hours more effectively to assure that you are
                    achieving the greatest quantity and quality of the things you want in exchange for the time you
                    invest. <br><br>
                <li><b>TRADING YOUR TIME</b>
                  <p> <br>Everything in life is a trade of some kind. Overall, you trade your time for the results and
                    rewards you want.You can tell what kind of a trader you are by looking around you and evaluating
                    your current situation. Are you satisfied with the results of your trades in life so far?
                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspSome people trade their time for $25,000 per year. Some people trade
                    the same amount of time for $250,000 per year, even though they may be of similar age and
                    intelligence, and have similar educations and backgrounds. But one of them earns 10 times what the
                    other earns! Why is this? <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn the simplest of terms, the one earning
                    more thinks and acts differently from the one earning less. One person is a better ''trader'' than
                    the other. One person has better information, continually upgrades his skills, starts earlier, works
                    harder, and stays later. A good trader quickly develops the winning edge, and begins to pull ahead
                    of the pack. Soon, he is working and earning at a far higher level than the people he started out
                    with. This must be your goal as well. <br><br>
                <li><b>YOUR TIME IS LIMITED</b>
                  <p> <br>You cannot save time.You can only spend it differently. Every part of your life today shows
                    the results of how you have spent your time in the past. If you want to have a different future, you
                    have to spend your time differently in the present.You have to change your thinking about yourself
                    and how you use your time to get the things you want in life. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspTime,
                    in a way, is like money. It can be either spent or invested. If you spend time or money, it is gone
                    forever.You can never get it back. But it you invest your time or money wisely, you will get a
                    greater return in the future. Personal strategic planning and thinking give you the tools to ensure
                    that you achieve the highest return on time invested (ROTI). Put another way, it enables you to get
                    the highest ''return on life.'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspEverything you do that requires your
                    time represents a choice. The choice is to use your time wisely or not. However you choose, the time
                    will be gone forever. If you spend your time on one activity, you will no longer have that same
                    quantity of time available to spend or invest in another activity.Your choices about how you use
                    your time largely determine the quality of your life, both today and in the future. <br><br>&nbsp
                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYou must be extremely jealous of your time. You must be adamant about not spending
                    your time on activities of low value. You must downsize, outsource, and eliminate all activities
                    that no longer represent the highest and best use of your time if you want to get the highest return
                    on energy in your life and career. Zero-based thinking will help you to make better choices. It is a
                    key thinking <br><br>
                <li><b>THE PARETO PRINCIPLE</b>
                  <p> <br>Another important strategic planning concept is the 80/20 Rule, the ''Pareto Principle,''
                    which Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto wrote about in 1895 in Switzerland. This rule says that 80
                    percent of your results will come from 20 percent of your activities. If you make a list of 10 tasks
                    that you have to do in the coming day, two of those items will be worth more than the other eight
                    items put together. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspBut the 20 percent of activities that account for
                    most of the value in your work are invariably the most difficult and challenging tasks. The 80
                    percent of activities that account for only 20 percent of your results are usually fun and easy.
                    Being human, you have a natural tendency to do the easy things, even though they are not
                    particularly valuable or important. To get the most done and the greatest results from every minute
                    invested, you must <i>resist the temptation to clear up small things first.</i>You must discipline
                    yourself to keep your energies focused on the one or two things that you can do that are more
                    important and valuable than anything else. <br><br>
                <li><b>MARKETING YOURSELF STRATEGICALLY</b>
                  <p> <br>As the president of your own personal services corporation, you must consider the four
                    strategic variables in marketing yourself and your services.Your effectiveness in each of these four
                    areas will determine your income and your future. They are: (1) specialization; (2) differentiation;
                    (3) segmentation; and (4) concentration. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThese four activities are
                    central to every business and to the success of every product or service offered by any business
                    anywhere. All business growth and profitability are the result of performing well in each of these
                    areas. Problems with sales and profitability are the result of a weakness in one or more of these
                    areas. Each of them applies to you and your career, as well. <br><br>
                <li><b>SPECIALIZE IN YOUR FIELD</b>
                  <p> <br>Specialization means that you decide exactly what it is that you are going to do, and do well,
                    in your field. Successful people in every field specialize rather than generalize. They focus their
                    time and talents rather than trying to do too many things. They work to develop a reputation for
                    being very, very good in a specific area. They don't try to be all things to all people or jacksof-
                    all-trades. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspA successful business may specialize in a particular type
                    of customer or in a specific market. It may specialize in a particular product or service for that
                    type of customer. A successful salesperson will specialize in selling a particular product or
                    service to a particular type of customer. A successful person in any field will spend more and more
                    time doing fewer and fewer things that are of higher and higher value in a specific area.
                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhat is your area of specialization today? What will it be in the
                    future? What should it be if you want to move to the top of your field? What could it be if you were
                    to stand back and imagine that you have no limitations, and that you could be excellent at any
                    skill, or in any market, that you desired? <br><br>
                <li><b>SET YOURSELF APART</b>
                  <p> <br><br>The second strategic variable in your business or career is differentiation. This is the
                    key factor that determines the success of most sales, marketing, and business growth. This is the
                    primary determinant of success in your career. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspDifferentiation is
                    defined as the way that you separate yourself from everyone else in your field who is offering
                    something similar. Your area of differentiation is, in reality, your area of excellence, your area
                    of uniqueness, your unique selling proposition. It is what gives you a competitive advantage over
                    others in your industry. <br><br>
                <li><b>THE KEY QUESTION</b>
                  <p> <br>Imagine if a very important prospective customer were to ask you, ''What is it about your
                    product or service that is different, better, and superior to any other similar product or service
                    offered by any other company in today's market?'' How would you answer? If you had to explain how
                    and why your product or service is superior to that of your competitors, what would you say?
                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspMany salespeople, and even business owners, are not sure about the
                    answer to this question. But you must be absolutely clear about your competitive advantage if you
                    want to make more sales in an increasingly competitive market. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAs an
                    individual, doing personal strategic planning for your own career, you must ask this question of
                    yourself.What unique skills do you have that make you superior to anyone else offering to do the
                    same job that you are doing? What skills would it be useful for you to have? If you are not
                    currently excellent in your field, what steps do you need to take, beginning immediately, to get
                    yourself to the point where you stand out from everyone else? <br><br><b><b>>>Identify Your Ideal
                        Customers <br>The third strategic area in business is that of segmentation. This requires that
                        you divide your markets and customers into segments. You do this by identifying those customers
                        who can most benefit from your area of specialization and your competitive advantage within that
                        area. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn segmentation, you identify your ideal customers.Who are
                        they? Where are they? What do they have in common? What are their ages, incomes, education
                        levels, backgrounds, positions, experiences, and so on? Today, more and more marketing is
                        focused on niches and microniches. Sales and marketing are increasingly personal and individual,
                        aimed at tightly defined groups of prospective customers with special qualities and
                        characteristics.Who are your ideal customers? <br><br>
                <li><b>CONCENTRATE YOUR ENERGIES</b>
                  <p> <br>The fourth strategic variable, perhaps the most important of all in sales and marketing, is
                    the principle of concentration. This is your ability to focus all of your energies and resources on
                    those specific customers or markets where you have the greatest chance of success in the shortest
                    period of time. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYour ability to concentrate single-mindedly on your
                    highestvalue opportunities will do more to increase your return on energy than any other factor.
                    Concentration is a key success principle in every field. <br><br>
                <li><b>SUCCESS VERSUS FAILURE</b>
                  <p> <br>Dun & Bradstreet has been tracking the results of successful and unsuccessful businesses for
                    more than 50 years. Not long ago, it put all of its research on failed businesses into a computer.
                    The data showed that businesses fail because of ''low sales.'' Businesses succeed because of ''high
                    sales.'' Everything else is commentary. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAs the president of your own
                    company, engaged in personal strategic planning for your career, your job is to ensure the highest
                    level of sales of your personal services that you can possibly achieve. This requires that you
                    specialize, differentiate, segment, and concentrate. As the president of your own life and career,
                    you must become absolutely excellent at doing one or two things that the market will pay the most
                    for.You must then become continually better in those one or two areas. <br><br>
                <li><b>YOU ARE EXTRAORDINARY</b>
                  <p> <br>The fact is that you are extraordinary.You are born with unique talents and abilities that
                    make you completely different from all other human beings who have ever existed. The odds of there
                    being two people just like you are more than 50 billion to one. In fact, it will never happen.
                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThere is no one who has the unique and remarkable combination of
                    experiences, ideas, thoughts, feelings, education, and imagination that you do.You have within you,
                    right now, the ability to be, have, or do virtually anything you can imagine.You are very much like
                    Michelangelo's block of marble, just lying there.You are like an incredible masterpiece just waiting
                    to emerge. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspGreat success and happiness come when you identify your
                    natural abilities, and then concentrate on developing along the lines of your inborn talents. It is
                    almost as though you are engineered for success in a specific way, and if you can find the area for
                    which you were specifically designed, you will achieve more in a few years than most people achieve
                    in a lifetime. <br><br>
                <li><b>LEAVE NOTHING TO CHANCE</b>
                  <p> <br>You leave nothing to chance.You don't hope for miracles or wish for a lucky break.You
                    recognize that if it's to be, it's up to you.p <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspSince you know you are
                    going to have to spend the rest of your life working at something, you decide in advance that you
                    will do what you love to do.You will become everything you are capable of becoming by developing
                    your unique talents and abilities, wherever they lead.You will work only at something you enjoy,
                    with people you enjoy, doing work that makes a difference in the world. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                    &nbspYou set high standards for yourself. You think positively and constructively about your career
                    and your future. You recognize that anything that anyone else has done you can do as well. Once you
                    have decided what it is you want to do, you throw your whole heart into doing it <br><br><b>&nbsp

                            achievement in real life begins.</i></b></p>

                      <p> <br>The people you know, and who know you in a favorable way, will do more to determine your
                        success, happiness, and level of achievement in life than any other single factor. No one
                        achieves anything of consequence by himself or herself. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn life,
                        relationships are everything. My friend Charlie Jones says, ''You will be in five years what you
                        are today except for the books you read and the people you meet.'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                        &nbspDr. David McClelland, author of The Achieving Society (Van Nostrand, 1961), concluded after
                        25 years of research at Harvard that your choice of a ''reference group'' would have more to do
                        with your success than anything else. McClelland interviewed graduates of the university, as
                        well as those who had attended his intensive seminars on achievement in American life. He
                        tracked these people for many years. Many of them took what they had learned and did wonderful
                        things with it. They built profitable businesses and successful careers. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                        &nbsp &nbspHowever, many of the graduates failed to turn the information and ideas they had
                        learned into later success.Why not? When he went back and surveyed them, he found that
                        invariably they had returned to the same group of people they had been associating with before
                        they had taken the advanced courses on achievement. As a result, they went back to the same old
                        ways, the same old habits, the same old customs and manners of living. Because they were
                        immersed in their old reference groups, nothing changed for them. <br><br>
                    <li><b>YOUR REFERENCE GROUP</b>
                      <p> <br>Your reference group is defined as the people you consider yourself to be similar to. For
                        example, if you belong to a particular church, the members of that church are part of your
                        reference group.You consider yourself to be like them. If you belong to a political party, a
                        bowling league, or a particular profession, people in those groups and organizations are parts
                        of your reference group. You identify strongly with them. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOver
                        time, through a process of absorption, you will adopt their attitudes, mannerisms, ways of
                        speaking, levels of aspiration, and even their style of dress. Your reference group will exert
                        an inordinate influence on the kind of person you become.You will adjust your goals, behaviors,
                        and thoughts to be consistent with what you feel they will approve of.You see this with
                        teenagers all the time. <br><br>
                    <li><b>MAKE NEW CHOICES</b>
                      <p> <br>All change in your outer world begins with a change in your inner world. Major changes in
                        your inner world start happening when you change the people with whom you associate and
                        identify.When you select a new reference group, or find yourself in a situation with different
                        people, you unconsciously begin to change, almost in spite of yourself. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                        &nbsp &nbspThis change process works quite quickly. In my speaking and travels, I have worked
                        with countless men and women all over the country and throughout the world who have taken this
                        advice to heart. They have deliberately changed their reference groups. They have begun
                        associating with different people in different organizations. Very soon, they began to think
                        differently about themselves, and their outer worlds begin to change. <br><br>
                    <li><b>AS A MAN THINKETH</b>
                      <p> <br>The Law of Correspondence says that your outer world is a mirror of your inner world. It
                        says in the Bible, ''As a man thinketh, so is he.''This means that as you see yourself and think
                        about yourself in your conscious mind, your perception of outer world changes and conforms to
                        fit a picture consistent with it. This is the central message of this book. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                        &nbsp &nbspThe most influential factors in your thinking and feeling will almost always be the
                        other people in your life. Successful people are those who form the habit of associating with
                        other positive, successoriented people. Unsuccessful people, by default, end up associating with
                        people who are not going anywhere with their lives. Both sets of people become more and more
                        like the people with whom they most identify. <br><br>
                    <li><b>FORM A NEW REFERENCE GROUP</b>
                      <p> <br>If you really want to change your thinking and your life, make a decision today to begin
                        associating, in every area of your life, with other men and women whom you admire, respect, and
                        look up to. Resolve to associate with people whom you enjoy and from whom you can learn.Work and
                        socialize only with the kind of people that you want your children to be like when they grow
                        up.When you set these kinds of standards for your interpersonal relationships, your whole life
                        will begin to improve almost immediately. <br><br>
                    <li><b>DEVELOP YOUR OWN NETWORK</b>
                      <p> <br>Your network is composed of the number of people you know, both directly and indirectly.
                        These are people over whom you can exert some influence and who can in turn exert some influence
                        over you. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe most successful people in our society, at every
                        level, are those who know the greatest number of other successful people. They organize their
                        lives to meet these successful people by deliberate design, not by accident. And so can you.
                        <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspMany men and women, over time, move from one city to another, or
                        from one field or industry to another. They start off with few contacts, yet in no time at all,
                        they become some of the bestknown and most respected people in their new field.Why does this
                        happen? It is because they apply the principles of creative networking to their new lives.
                        <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThey immediately begin to form new, positive reference groups.
                        They put into action a plan to develop as many good, high-quality relationships as possible
                        within the shortest period of time. <br><br>
                    <li><b>BUILDING YOUR NETWORK</b>
                      <p> <br>Here is a great exercise for you. Over the course of the next six months to a year, make a
                        list in a notebook of the 100 most important people in your community. As you gather these names
                        from the newspapers, from conversations, from news broadcasts, and from your work as you move
                        around, begin to think of how you could get to meet and know these people. Remember, the more
                        people you know and who know and think about you in a positive way, the more successful you will
                        be in every area of your life. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOnce you have your list of 100
                        people, you should add to it regularly. Begin to network systematically with these people. Once
                        you have a name, think of how you could communicate with that person. The simplest way of all is
                        to write a letter expressing your opinion on something that the individual is involved in, or
                        simply expressing your congratulations on the person's success for something recently achieved.
                        <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspBe patient when you start to expand your circle of contacts.
                        Don't expect the person you wrote to call you back or to come in your door to meet with you.You
                        are in the business of sowing seeds. Sometime down the road, you may see that the person has
                        done something else and you can write another letter. Over time, these little efforts will begin
                        to bear fruit. <br><br>
                    <li><b>PATIENCE PAYS OFF</b>
                      <p> <br>I write letters continually to people that I meet throughout the country. I always send a
                        copy of a poem, sometimes a book, sometimes an audio program or something that I feel the other
                        person would enjoy. I have done this over the years for hundreds and perhaps thousands of
                        people. Now, wherever I go, people come up to me and remind me that I wrote to them and sent
                        them something, often years ago. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspA couple of years ago, I was in
                        Washington, D.C., at a high-level conference, and a senior person from one of the largest
                        organizations in the nation's capital came up to me and reminded me that I had written to him
                        and sent him something five years before. He still remembered. After this meeting, over time, I
                        got to know him very well. He has now introduced me to a variety of other powerful people. These
                        new relationships have turned out to be very enjoyable and productive for me. They all started
                        with me sitting down and writing a friendly letter. <br><br>
                    <li><b>ADVANCING YOUR CAREER</b>
                      <p> <br>Fully 85 percent of the best jobs in the United States are filled through contacts, rather
                        than through want ads or recruitment agencies. Someone has the need for a particular job to be
                        filled and lets it be known within a network. The word goes out from person to person, and an
                        individual who could never be found any other way often surfaces and is directed, as the result
                        of personal connections, to a job for which the person is well suited. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                        &nbspMany people have found that by broadening their contacts whenever they got a chance, they
                        have changed their work lives profoundly. When they did change careers, they just happened to
                        know the right person who was in the right place to make the right introduction to get the right
                        job that saved the individual years of hard work in reaching that same level of responsibility
                        and income. <br><br>
                    <li><b>BE A JOINER</b>
                      <p> <br>The major focus of networking developed by most high-achieving men and women and self-made
                        millionaires is their regular involvement with groups, clubs, and associations that contain
                        members who can be of assistance to them in their particular fields. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                        &nbspIn my own experience, moving from one city to another, I found that by joining certain
                        clubs and organizations and getting involved, I was able to develop more friendships and make
                        more progress in a couple of years than many people had made in 10 or 20 years. <br><br>&nbsp
                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbspMake a decision, right now, to join one or two clubs or associations. The first
                        association you should join should be the one for your profession or occupation. If you are in
                        real estate, join the real estate board. If you are an entrepreneur, join an entrepreneurial
                        association. If you are in sales, join a club like Sales and Marketing Executives International.
                        <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen you join a professional association, don't make the mistake
                        of merely attending the meetings and going home. This is what 80 to 90 percent of the members
                        do. They may get some benefit from their membership with the organization, but nowhere near as
                        much benefit as you can get by becoming more involved. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspHere is
                        your strategy. When you join a club or organization, get the membership book and look at the
                        various committees. Ask around and find out which of the committees is the most active and
                        important to the organization. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspSometimes it is the membership
                        committee. Sometimes it is the government relations committee. Sometimes it is the education
                        committee or the fund-raising committee. But whatever it is, find out what committee seems to
                        have the greatest impact on the health and growth of the organization, and then volunteer to
                        serve on that committee. There will almost always be an opening for someone willing to help.
                        <br><br>
                    <li><b>DONATE YOUR TIME</b>
                      <p> <br>When you attend meetings of that committee, develop the habit of raising your hand.
                        Volunteer for assignments. Volunteer to write things.Volunteer to do work that needs to be done.
                        <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe rule is this: In every organization, fewer than 10 percent of
                        the people do most of the work. On any committee, fewer than 20 percent of the people do more
                        than 80 percent of the work on that committee.Your goal is to be among that top 10 to 20
                        percent. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe most important committees attract the best and most
                        important people in the association. These are the kinds of people that you want as part of your
                        reference group. These are the kinds of people that you want to form relationships with.These
                        are the kinds of people whose names you want for your Rolodex, and who you want to be a part of
                        your professional network. <br><br>
                    <li><b>PERFORMING FOR YOUR PEERS</b>
                      <p> <br>One of the great advantages of serving voluntarily on a committee for your association is
                        that you get an opportunity to perform in front of your peers, but without ever attempting to
                        impress them or to get them to give you anything or do anything for you. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                        &nbsp &nbspEvery time you accept a responsibility and fulfill it completely, they make a silent
                        note of it. They may not say anything aside from an occasional thanks or congratulations, but
                        they are making mental notes, which will serve you in good stead later on. <br><br>
                    <li><b>LEARN TO SPEAK ON YOUR FEET</b>
                      <p> <br>If you have any fears about public speaking, you should make a plan, right now, to get
                        over them.Your ability to make a presentation to a small group or to stand up and give a talk or
                        chair a meeting for a larger group can do more to bring you to the attention of people who can
                        help you than almost any other thing you can do. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspFortunately,
                        public speaking is a skill you can learn with practice. I have urged people over the years to
                        take a Dale Carnegie course or to join Toastmasters International. They are both open to
                        everyone and available everywhere. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen you sign up or join one
                        of these fine organizations, leaders will train you thoroughly in how to speak on your feet.
                        They will teach you how to design a talk - with a beginning, a middle, and an end. They will
                        show you how to speak in a variety of different situations. And the better you get at speaking,
                        by the Law of Attraction, the more you will attract people and opportunities into your life to
                        speak to more and larger groups. <br><br>
                    <li><b>LOOK FOR WAYS TO PUT IN</b>
                      <p> <br>Here's something very important that I learned. The great majority of people, being
                        selfish, are always thinking of how they can personally and immediately gain from any
                        interaction that they have with other people. But this is not for you. Instead, your job is to
                        look for ways to put in.Your goal must be to look for ways to contribute. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                        &nbsp &nbspThis seems to be the strategy used by many of the top people.Over the years, I have
                        worked with many wealthy men and women. I will never forget a billionaire turning to me at the
                        end of a meeting and privately asking me, ''Is there anything that I can do for you?'' Later,
                        another man, worth more than $500 million, asked me the same question: ''Is there any way that I
                        can help you?'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen I went to work for a man worth over $800
                        million, in our second or third meeting, he asked me if there was anything that he could do in
                        his position to help me in my personal life. By that simple gesture, even though I could think
                        of nothing, he earned my lifelong loyalty. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOver the years, I have
                        observed that many of the most powerful men and women, at every level of society, got there by
                        continually looking for ways to help other people. <br><br>
                    <li><b>LIVING THE LAW</b>
                      <p> <br>Here is one of the greatest discoveries of the ages:<i> The more you give of yourself
                          without expectation of return, the more that will come to you from the most unexpected
                          sources.</i> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspMost people think that if they do something good
                        or helpful for a person or group, their rewards should come back directly from that person or
                        group. But this is not the way the universe works. When you do something nice for someone else,
                        you activate the law of attraction. Because it is a law, you never have to worry about your
                        reward. As long as you continue to sow goodness, the universe will take care of the reaping.Your
                        good will usually come to you from a completely unexpected source, and at a completely
                        unexpected time. All you have to do is be sure that you are continually putting in. The getting
                        out will take care of itself. <br><br>
                    <li><b>THE BEST PEOPLE</b>
                      <p> <br>As a professional speaker, I work with groups and associations all over the country.
                        Without fail, the best and most talented people in every association are the ones who attend
                        almost every meeting. The top people are the ones who always take the time and make the
                        sacrifice to be there. They are the ones who always sit on the committees and volunteer to help
                        in any way possible. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAnd I have noticed an interesting
                        phenomenon. Each year, one member of the association will be elected to be the national
                        president. As the president, he or she will have to spend as much as half of his or her time
                        traveling around the country voluntarily, without pay, on association business. <br><br>&nbsp
                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYou would think that this would really cut into the person's ability to make a
                        living. But it seems that exactly the opposite happens. All the association presidents I've
                        spoken to found that they made more money, did better in their careers, and made more progress
                        in their field in the year that they took off to work for the association than in any other year
                        of their work lives. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe more you put in, without expectation of
                        reward, the more you get back from the most unexpected sources. And you are in complete control
                        of what you put in. The universe will take care of the rest. <br><br>
                    <li><b>KEEP A RECORD</b>
                      <p> <br>Harvey Mackay, in his audio program, How to Build a Network of Power Relationships, says
                        that the most important word not in the dictionary (at that time) is the word ''Rolodex.'' He
                        claims that, if your Rolodex is big enough, you are never more than two phone calls away from
                        anyone in the country. Harvey Mackay has a Rolodex with more than four thousand names that he
                        has gathered over the years. He has found that at least one of those people in his Rolodex has
                        direct access to virtually any other person in the country with whom he wants to communicate,
                        including the president of the United States. <br><br>
                    <li><b>YOUR MASTERMIND ALLIANCE</b>
                      <p> <br>Napoleon Hill, after decades of studying the richest men in America, concluded that the
                        formation of a mastermind network was an important step to great wealth. It was the creation or
                        joining of a mastermind group that enabled countless men and women to go from poverty and
                        obscurity to success and affluence. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe core of your personal
                        network of contacts, even before you begin to go outside to join groups and organizations,
                        should therefore be your mastermind network. This is a small group of four or five people with
                        whom you meet and talk on a regular basis. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspGetting together
                        regularly, at least once per week or even more often, with other people who think like you do is
                        the key to the success of a mastermind group. Don't worry about being self-serving in these
                        relationships. Include in your mastermind only people you <br><br>
                    <li><b>TAKE THE INITIATIVE</b>
                      <p> <br>You begin the formation of a mastermind group by approaching one or two people you like
                        and admire, and who seem to have the same positive attitude you do. They may be in your field or
                        in another field. They may be younger or older than you, of the same gender or not. It doesn't
                        really matter as long as you have good chemistry. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe most
                        important qualifications are that they have positive mental attitudes and are generally
                        optimistic about themselves and their lives. They should have goals of their own that they are
                        working on each day. They should be open-minded and curious. They should believe in personal
                        development, and already read books, listen to audio programs, and attend courses and seminars.
                        <br><br>
                    <li><b>LOOSE OR STRUCTURED</b>
                      <p> <br>When you get together with members of your mastermind group, you can have an agenda, or no
                        agenda.Your meetings can be structured or unstructured.You can talk about general subjects or
                        specific topics.You may talk about your own business or about theirs. It doesn't matter. The
                        very activity of spending time around other positive people energizes you, makes you more
                        creative, and makes you feel more enthusiastic toward whatever you are doing. <br><br>&nbsp
                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAn important element of your mastermind group is the amount of laughter that
                        you experience together. This is the key measure of the quality of any of your relationships.
                        People who laugh a lot together like each other more.They are usually more helpful and
                        supportive of each other. The people you enjoy the most in life will always be the people with
                        whom you laugh and joke the most. <br><br>
                    <li><b>TWO PEOPLE TOGETHER</b>
                      <p> <br>The most important mastermind group that you ever form is with your spouse or partner. A
                        husband and wife together, or a couple, can be the most powerful mastermind of all. When two
                        people are completely attuned to each other, and completely supportive of each other's hopes and
                        dreams, they form a powerful combination that enables each of them to accomplish far more than
                        either could achieve alone. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspPeople who are in an excellent
                        relationship with a person they describe as their best friend are some of the happiest, most
                        successful, and most fulfilled people in our society. Two people together can create wonderful
                        things for both of them. <br><br>
                    <li><b>MULTIPLE MASTERMINDS</b>
                      <p> <br>You can have more than one mastermind network. Some people will have a mastermind network
                        in their families. Others will have mastermind alliances with people who participate in the same
                        hobbies or sports. You should definitely have a mastermind network that is specifically focused
                        on your work or career. You can even have interlocking mastermind groups with people who are
                        involved with you in more than one area. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe more you interact
                        with other positive people, the more positive and productive you will be. Constantly talking
                        with and sharing your ideas and experiences with others will give you a steady flow of ideas and
                        insights from their experiences, and help you keep a healthy perspective on what you are doing.
                        <br><br>
                    <li><b>GUARD YOUR TIME</b>
                      <p> <br>Your most valuable asset is your time, and relationships with people are enormously
                        time-consuming. The number of high-quality relationships you can form and maintain is limited.
                        There are simply not enough hours in the day or enough days in the month.You must be selective
                        about the people with whom you associate. You must choose them carefully. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                        &nbsp &nbspBaron de Rothschild, in his Maxims for Success, said, ''Make no useless
                        acquaintances.'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThis may sound a bit cold, but remember, your
                        life is precious, and your life is made up of the minutes and hours of each day.You cannot
                        afford to squander it on relationships with people whom you cannot help, and who cannot help
                        you, to live and enjoy a better life. You must guard your time carefully. As Benjamin Franklin
                        wrote, <i>''Dost thou love life? Then do not squander time; for that's the stuff life is made
                          of.''</i> <br><br>
                    <li><b>BE SELECTIVE IN YOUR CHOICES</b>
                      <p> <br>Many highly successful people are often described as ''loners.'' However, this does not
                        mean ''a-loners.''They are not isolated, antisocial individuals. They are loners in that they
                        are highly selective about who they spend time with. They do not drink coffee with whoever is
                        sitting there, or go out for lunch with whoever happens to be walking out the door at the same
                        time. They carefully build and maintain high-quality relationships, and they fastidiously avoid
                        negative people who might hold them back. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIf associating with
                        positive people is a key to success, then the flip side is for you to get away and keep away
                        from negative or ''toxic'' people. Negative people are the primary source of most unhappiness.
                        Problems with such people are most likely your major sources of stress and frustration. Negative
                        people do more to diminish your joy in life than any other single factor. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                        &nbsp &nbspIt's much easier to bounce back from financial loss or reverses in your career than
                        it is to deal with negative people in your work or personal life. One major negative
                        relationship can be enough to cut off all your chances of achieving your full potential in your
                        career. Choose your relationships with care. <br><br>
                    <li><b>SEEK OUT A MENTOR</b>
                      <p> <br>Most successful people have mentors at different stages of their lives. A person whom you
                        know and who knows you and helps you on a regular basis often determines your success in life.
                        The right mentor at the right time can save you from countless mistakes and years of hard work.
                        <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAt each stage of your life you can benefit from the advice and
                        experience of someone who is further along the path than you.The men who have been there to give
                        me guidance and advice as I have grown up and gone into business at various levels have affected
                        my life dramatically. This type of relationship can have a major impact on your success as well.
                        <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspMany people are a little bit fuzzy about exactly how mentoring
                        relationships work. A mentor is like an uncle. He or she is an older friend, someone wiser and
                        more experienced than you, who will give you guidance and advice from time to time. A mentor can
                        help you avoid pitfalls that might sidetrack your career or hold you back. <br><br>
                    <li><b>DEVELOP A STRATEGY</b>
                      <p> <br>As it happens, the best potential mentors are successful people who are already very busy.
                        Approaching one of them requires strategy and planning. Here is what you do. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                        &nbsp &nbspWhen you decide that you would like a particular person to be your mentor in a
                        particular area, you should contact that person with a specific question or need. Most
                        successful people are open to helping other people who want to be successful as well, but they
                        are busy. They don't have a lot of time. You should not ask for more than 10 minutes.
                        <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe best way to approach a prospective mentor for the first time
                        is with a short list of key questions for which you need answers to help you to make current
                        decisions in your life and your career. Do not approach a mentor asking personal questions about
                        his or her life and experiences. Busy people are not interested in sharing their innermost
                        experiences and feelings with someone they have never met before. <br><br>
                    <li><b>LOOK FOR COMPATIBILITY</b>
                      <p> <br>In your first meeting, by asking a few specific questions, you are testing the waters.What
                        you are looking for is a certain form of chemistry. You are looking for a person you like and
                        respect and feel comfortable with, and who likes you and will be willing to help you in the
                        future. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspFor this reason, you must go slowly at first. You must
                        ask for only a few minutes, and then you must get on with your business. You must ask for
                        specific advice about a specific situation. Be respectful, friendly, and businesslike.
                        <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspHere is the key to developing the mentor/mentee relationship.
                        When you are given advice, follow it. Don't ask for specific advice and do nothing with it, and
                        then attempt to come back for even more advice. This just demonstrates to the prospective mentor
                        that you are wasting his or her time. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspInstead, if the person
                        suggests that you take a particular action, do it immediately. If the mentor suggests that you
                        read a book, get it and read it. If he suggests that you listen to an audio program, get it and
                        listen to it. If she suggests that you take a particular course, sign up for it and attend.
                        <br><br>
                    <li><b>BE RESPECTFUL OF THEIR TIME</b>
                      <p> <br>Many people contact me and ask me to be a mentor to them, not only from throughout the
                        United States and Canada but from foreign countries as well. Aside from the fact that I am
                        extremely busy, I respectfully decline all invitations because of the particular approach that
                        they usually take. They call up or write and want me to take complete charge of their lives.
                        They want me to spend many hours of my time guiding, counseling, and directing them, and helping
                        them in their jobs or careers. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe fact is that a prospective
                        mentor is usually very busy and cannot even consider the possibility of spending large blocks of
                        time with a complete stranger. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspHowever, if you go slowly and you
                        follow the advice given to you by a mentor, the individual may conclude that investing time in
                        you is worthwhile. He or she will be willing to spend even more time with you to help you even
                        further. Eventually, a very good relationship can develop. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYou
                        may have more than one mentor at the same time, and you may have sequential mentors.This means
                        that as one mentor serves his or her purpose in guiding you, and you evolve and grow in your
                        career, it will often be time to move on to another mentor who is even further along than your
                        first mentor. <br><br>
                    <li><b>RESIST RELATIONSHIP ENTROPY</b>
                      <p> <br>The natural tendency in all relationships is toward entropy. Relationship entropy means
                        that relationships run out of energy unless they are continually renewed. People stop doing the
                        things that they had done earlier to establish the relationship in the first place. They work
                        very hard to create the relationship, and then they take it for granted. They forget to
                        communicate with the other person. They just assume that everything is going along fine and that
                        no extra efforts are necessary to maintain the relationship. As it happens, men are more likely
                        than women to let this happen. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspBut all relationships are a
                        function of the time invested in them. You can only increase the value of a relationship by
                        investing more time in it. This applies to a relationship with your spouse, relationships with
                        your children, relationships with your staff members, and especially relationships with your
                        friends and associates on a personal and professional level. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                        &nbspThere is no alternative to personal time invested in building and maintaining a
                        relationship.You must be alert to the danger of relationship entropy and be constantly working
                        to counter it. <br><br>
                    <li><b>CUSTOMERS FOR LIFE</b>
                      <p> <br>It is quite common in business for someone to work very hard to win a customer for the
                        first time and to build the initial relationship. However, once the relationship is established,
                        the businessperson begins to take the customer for granted and go off to work on new
                        relationships that are not yet well established. Then, six months later, the businessperson is
                        astonished to find that the customer has gone to a competitor. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAs
                        a businessperson, your customer relationships are some of the most important assets that you
                        develop and maintain over the course of your career. Once you have invested the time and energy
                        required to develop a customer relationship, it is essential that you develop a plan for
                        relationship maintenance. You make sure that you are doing whatever is necessary to keep that
                        relationship alive and growing. <br><br>
                    <li><b>THE LAW OF INDIRECT EFFORT</b>
                      <p> <br>There are several principles that apply to building and maintaining relationships of all
                        kinds. Perhaps the most important is the Law of Indirect Effort. This law says that <i>you
                          achieve things with people more indirectly than directly.</i> Here are some examples of this
                        principle. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIf you want to have a friend, the direct way is by
                        trying to get people to like you. This seldom works. The indirect way is to be a friend, to
                        treat other people in a friendly way without expecting anything in return. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                        &nbsp &nbspIf you want to impress other people, the direct way is to tell them about your
                        accomplishments and show them how clever you are. The indirect way, which is faster and more
                        effective, is to be impressed by them. The more you show that you are impressed by someone, the
                        more they will find you to be an impressive person. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe indirect
                        way of getting people to like you is for you to like them first. The way to get people to admire
                        and respect you is for you to admire and respect them in advance. <br><br>
                    <li><b>THE LAW OF COMPENSATION</b>
                      <p> <br>The Law of Compensation seems to apply directly to relationships. This law says that you
                        get out what you put in, and the more you put in, the more you get out. The more things that you
                        do for other people, the more things other people will want to do for you.When you offer to help
                        or serve others, they will want to help or serve you. What goes around comes around.Whatever you
                        sow you will eventually reap. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWe have entered into the era of the
                        ''go-giver'' rather than just the go-getter. Each person has a deep desire to reciprocate in his
                        or her relations with others.We want to even things up when anything nice has been done for
                        us.We want to pay people back for any kindnesses or favors. We don't want to feel that we are
                        obligated to another. Nowhere is this principle more important than in relationships.
                        <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThere are many people who think that the key to success is to get
                        around other successful people and then to exploit this relationship. This strategy seldom
                        works. It is much better for you to become the kind of person that other people want to be
                        around.When you go to work on yourself and become a better person, better people will want to
                        associate with you. This is the indirect way. <br><br>
                    <li><b>MARRY RICH</b>
                      <p> <br>Sometimes people say they want to marry a rich person. If you want to marry a rich person,
                        by the law of indirect effort you had better get busy working on yourself to become the kind of
                        man or woman that a rich person would want to marry. You should become very good at what you do,
                        and develop the manners of an excellent person. Improvement of your life and prospects on the
                        outside begins with your getting better on the inside. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThere have
                        been many studies of social climbers, people who have joined clubs and organizations in an
                        attempt to associate with other successful people. Invariably they fail.Why? Because like
                        attracts like. People are naturally attracted to people who are at the same level that they are.
                        If you have not developed yourself to achieve a certain level of accomplishment in your field,
                        you cannot take a shortcut and begin associating with people at that new higher level.They will
                        not be interested in you, and you will only end up looking and feeling foolish. <br><br>
                    <li><b>RELATIONSHIPS ARE EVERYTHING</b>
                      <p> <br>Keep it foremost in your mind that relationships are everything. Your job is to become a
                        relationship-creating individual.You should look for every way possible - in your personal
                        reference groups, in your mastermind networks, in your clubs and associations, and with mentors
                        - to form and maintain high-quality relationships. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspMost
                        successful men and women owe their success to the fact that, at an earlier time, they made the
                        effort to establish and maintain a particular relationship that eventually paid off for them.
                        Doors were opened and opportunities created that saved them years of hard work. And this can
                        happen to you as well, if you use creative networking at every stage of your career.
                        <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen you know that your Rolodex contains hundreds of valuable
                        names that you can call upon because you have already built a bridge with these people, it gives
                        you a tremendous feeling of personal power and self-confidence.You begin to feel unstoppable.

                              educated person dies, it is as if a library burned down.''</i> This potential library is

                        <li><b>THE ORIGINS OF WEALTH</b>
                          <p> <br>Throughout human history, value has been contained in land, labor, capital, furniture,
                            fixtures, machinery, and other hard assets. Wars and revolutions have been fought over their
                            control. The primary creators of value were those people who could combine these various
                            resources together to produce products and services for the marketplace. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                            &nbsp &nbspIn the twentieth century, however, we have seen change take place at a speed that
                            is virtually unimaginable. In 1900, 50 percent of the American population lived on farms
                            raising food for the other 50 percent who lived in towns and cities.Today, less than 3
                            percent of the population lives on farms, and they produce not only enough food for all
                            Americans, but huge surpluses as well that are exported or even given away to the entire
                            world. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWe have moved from the agricultural age to the
                            industrial age to the service age to the information age, and we are now entering the
                            communications age. The primary source of value today is not land, labor, and other hard
                            assets, but knowledge, information, and ideas. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe greatest
                            wealth you could possibly possess is between your ears.You can create an unlimited future
                            for yourself by tapping into your brainpower and channeling it, like a powerful current, to
                            energize your life and get you anything you really want. <br><br>
                        <li><b>TRUE WEALTH TODAY</b>
                          <p> <br>The richest American today, and perhaps the richest person in the world, is Bill
                            Gates. The net worth of his company, Microsoft, is greater than the net worth of IBM, which
                            has been in business many years longer. Microsoft is based entirely on brainpower. It
                            creates wealth by making it easier to process information digitally within computers, and
                            from computer to computer by telephone lines, wireless systems, and satellites.
                            <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIf you own a company, your chief assets walk out the door
                            every night at quitting time.Your building could burn to the ground, but as long as your
                            people got out safely, you could walk across the street and start your business again. The
                            chief assets of any organization, and of any individual, are contained in the ability to
                            think and to apply that thinking to getting results that other people will pay for. The
                            ability to create wealth is determined by mental strength rather than physical strength.
                            <br><br>
                        <li><b>STARTING CAPITAL</b>
                          <p> <br>In generations past, it may have taken many years for a person to accumulate enough
                            capital to start and build a successful business in manufacturing or services. Today, such a
                            large investment in physical assets can actually be a liability. A change in technology on
                            the other side of the world can render a $100 million manufacturing plant obsolete in a few
                            months. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspBut what you have between your ears can be
                            invaluable. It is capable of countless applications and uses. It is completely portable. It
                            is versatile. It is flexible, and can be increased almost without limits, if you learn how.
                            <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAn immigrant could arrive at a U.S. airport with the ability
                            to create a billion-dollar industry in his head. He could walk up to customs; open his hands
                            and say, ''Nothing to declare;'' and walk on through. His assets are all in his knowledge
                            and skill. Many of the most successful and respected entrepreneurs and businesspeople in
                            America arrived this way. <br><br>
                        <li><b>KNOWLEDGE IS THE GREAT RESOURCE</b>
                          <p> <br>The primary source of value today is knowledge. Since there is no limit to the amount
                            of knowledge you can acquire, there is no limit to the amount of value that you can
                            create.You can start from wherever you are, no matter what your background, and begin to
                            increase your mental assets. You can start work today on improving your ability to perform
                            and get results for which others will pay. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe wonderful
                            thing about knowledge is that it can be reproduced hundreds of thousands, even millions of
                            times without losing its value. It is the one commodity that can actually be infinite in its
                            application. If you or someone else comes up with a new idea to do something faster or
                            better, that idea can be spread around the world in no time at all, and be in the hands of
                            millions of other people who can also use it to improve their lives and work. And you have
                            lost nothing. The idea still has its original value to you. This is absolutely incredible.

                          <p> <br>Today, our banking and financial industries are struggling to make the shift to
                            knowledge as an asset. Banks, for example, will lend money today only against hard assets,
                            things that can be seized as collateral and sold to repay the loan. However, the real assets
                            of a company are not the tangible items at all. They are the thinking ability of the people
                            who work there. They are contained in the combined brainpower of teams of experts working
                            together to solve problems, create innovations, and produce goods and services for the
                            competitive marketplace. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYour ability to utilize your

                        <li><b>SMALL DIFFERENCES LEAD TO BIG RESULTS</b>
                          <p> <br>Often small improvements in the way you think and perform can lead to significant
                            improvements in your performance. It is not necessary for you to attend university and get
                            years of education to bring your knowledge up to the level where it can pay off for you.
                            Sometimes very small changes in what you are doing right now, right where you are, can bring
                            about amazing results. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspHere's an example. If a horse runs in
                            a horse race and wins by a nose, it earns 10 times the prize money of a horse that comes in
                            second. Does this mean that the horse that comes in first is 10 times faster? Is it twice as
                            fast? Ten percent faster? No, the horse that wins is only a nose faster. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                            &nbsp &nbspBy the same token, your possession of one small piece of information at the right
                            time and in the right place can enable you to make an extraordinary difference in a
                            particular situation. Often a single idea or insight can change your whole life or career.

                        <li><b>AVOID THE INTELLIGENCE TRAP</b>
                          <p> <br>The most successful people today are those who are continually investing in learning
                            and expanding their intellectual asset base.They are wide open to new ideas and new
                            approaches. A major mistake made by many people, especially those who have graduated from a
                            university, is that they conclude that everything they know at the moment is all that there
                            is to know about a particular subject.Sometimes they think that what they know is all they
                            need to know about a subject as well. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThis is called the
                            ''intelligence trap'' of the poor performer, the unconscious incompetent. This is a person
                            who does not know, and does not know that he does not know. This person cannot be helped,
                            because he is closed to new information.This is why the beginning of all wisdom is often the
                            awareness of how ignorant you really are, of how little you really know. <br><br>
                        <li><b>DON'T BE IMPRESSED</b>
                          <p> <br>I have traveled in many countries and met countless highly intelligent and successful
                            people. I have spoken with many millionaires, multimillionaires, and even billionaires. I
                            have worked at the highest level of government with some of the smartest men and women who
                            have ever lived. And the one thing that these people seem to have in common is that they
                            never become impressed by their own intelligence. In fact, the smarter they get, the humbler
                            they become and the less they look upon themselves as experts in any way. <br><br>&nbsp
                            &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOver 700 years ago, Roger Bacon of England was considered to be the last
                            universal man. He was thought to be current with all the knowledge and science of the day.
                            He, in his day, knew almost everything there was to know about everything that was taught
                            academically. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOf course, at that time, the amount of
                            available knowledge was limited. There were very few books. There were fewer scientists,
                            philosophers, and researchers writing and teaching. <br><br>
                        <li><b>KNOWLEDGE GROWS EXPONENTIALLY</b>
                          <p> <br>Today, however, it is impossible for one person to know everything about even one
                            small subject. Just look at modern medicine. There are great minds who spend their entire
                            lives studying the workings of the inner ear or the trachea or one of the other organs of
                            the body. And even though these highly intelligent and dedicated professionals spend their
                            whole careers specializing in a particular part of the body, they never learn everything
                            there is to know about even that one organ. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspSometimes I ask
                            audiences, ''Is there anyone here who is a know-it-all?'' Of course, no one raises his or
                            her hand. Then I go on to explain what I mean by a know-it-all. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                            &nbspA know-it-all is a person who feels that he knows everything that he needs to know
                            about a subject. How can you tell if you have become a know-it-all? It is easy. You have
                            stopped learning and growing in your area of specialization.You have stopped reading,
                            listening to audio programs, and taking additional courses. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                            &nbspThe very fact that you fail to regularly seek out new knowledge in your field means
                            that you have unconsciously, accidentally, slipped into the intelligence trap of the low
                            performer.You have unwittingly become a know-it-all by the very act of not continuing to
                            learn and grow. <br><br>
                        <li><b>THE ANSWERS ARE CHANGING</b>
                          <p> <br>After giving an advanced test to a graduate class of physics students at Princeton
                            University, Albert Einstein was on the way back to his office when one of his graduate
                            assistants asked the famous professor, ''Dr. Einstein, wasn't that the same exam that you
                            gave to this physics class last year?'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspDr. Einstein nodded
                            and said, ''Yes, it was the same exam as last year.'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe
                            graduate assistant summoned up his courage to ask the great Nobel prizewinning physicist,
                            ''But, Dr. Einstein, how could you give the same test two years in a row?'' <br><br>&nbsp
                            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp''Because,'' Einstein replied, ''in the last year, the answers have
                            changed.'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn the same way, your answers are changing today
                            at a more rapid rate than ever before. The answers in your field are changing as you sit
                            there. What was true a year ago may not be true today, and what is true today may not be
                            true a year from now. The only way that you can be assured of staying on top of your field
                            is by continually taking in new ideas and knowledge to compare it with what you know today.

                        <li><b>THE SOURCES OF INNOVATION</b>
                          <p> <br>Peter Drucker, in his book <i>Innovation and Entrepreneurship</i> (Harper- Business,
                            1985), writes that the greatest business breakthroughs take place as the result of ''either
                            the unexpected success or the unexpected failure.'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspHe
                            explains that when something unusual or unexpected happens in any field, the average person
                            dismisses it as a random event or as an accident. The superior person, however, studies each
                            unexpected result as if it were a sign of an underlying trend or an indication of a
                            fundamental change in the nature of things. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen an
                            experiment in growing bacteria failed because a mold had blown across the laboratory and
                            landed on the petri dish, killing the bacteria, the lab assistants were about to throw it
                            out. However, a bacteriologist, Alexander Fleming, became curious about a mold that was so
                            powerful that it could kill such strong bacteria. His research led to the discovery and
                            development of penicillin, which saved millions of lives in World War II and won him both a
                            knighthood and the Nobel prize. <br><br>
                        <li><b>KEEP YOUR MIND OPEN</b>
                          <p> <br>In 1975, IBM commissioned consultants to study the market potential of the personal
                            computer. They came back with the conclusion that the market for personal computers was only
                            a few hundred in the entire world, at best. Based on this information, IBM decided to
                            concentrate its efforts on mainframes, where it was already the world leader, and ignore the
                            personal computer market, leaving it to a little upstart company in Cupertino, California,
                            called Apple Computer. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen the Apple computers hit the
                            market and began to sell by the hundreds, and then thousands, IBM got smart fast. IBM did an
                            about-face and decided to plunge into the small computer business. And the company did. IBM
                            came out with a PC that within four years captured more than 50 percent of the world market
                            for smaller computers. <br><br>
                        <li><b>WATCH FOR THE TRENDS</b>
                          <p> <br>But IBM failed to notice that a major trend to smaller computers had taken place.
                            Ignoring its initial success in PCs, IBM continued to concentrate on the development and
                            sale of mainframes. While IBM's attention was focused on mainframes, more and more
                            competitors rushed into the personal computer field, and eventually IBM was displaced as the
                            world leader. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIBM failed to see that its success in capturing
                            50 percent of the personal computer market was indicative of a sweeping trend in computers
                            that would change the entire world. Today IBM is scrambling to catch up, competing with
                            companies like Dell Computer, Hewlett-Packard/Compaq, Toshiba, and others. Because IBM
                            missed the trend, it is unlikely that it will ever recover its position <br><br>
                        <li><b>THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE</b>
                          <p> <br>Keep your eyes open. There are more changes taking place all around you today than
                            ever before. Any one of these changes may be indicative of a trend that could lead on to
                            fortune and success for you.You must be open, awake, and alert to these changes. Nothing
                            remains the same for very long. All your best opportunities will come from applying your
                            knowledge and brainpower to new products and new services in the future. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                            &nbsp &nbspAll you need to start a fortune is an idea that is 10 percent new. All you need
                            is a product or service innovation that is a little better, faster, or cheaper than
                            something else, and you can quickly move to the front of the line. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                            &nbspMany of the great fortunes being made today in the United States and throughout the
                            world are being created by people who started with nothing. One day, they came up with a
                            breakthrough idea that revolutionized or transformed their industry.What could it be for
                            you? <br><br>
                        <li><b>TWO FACTORS THAT HOLD YOU BACK</b>
                          <p> <br>There are two major factors that stand in the way of you using more of your natural
                            intelligence. They are <i>psychosclerosis</i> and <i>homeostasis.</i> Psychosclerosis is
                            another name for ''hardening of the attitudes.'' This is experienced by a particular type of
                            person who is rigid, inflexible, and unchanging. This is the kind of person who develops
                            fixed attitudes on a certain person or subject and then resists any attempt to change his
                            mind. This is often called the mechanical way of thinking.You probably know people who
                            suffer from it. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe opposite way of thinking is more open and
                            flexible. This is called the adaptive worldview. Adaptive people keep their minds open to
                            new information. They are curious and interested in new ideas and developments. They are
                            more concerned with what's right than with who's right. They are willing to abandon an old
                            idea if someone can come along and show them that a new idea has more merit. They are more
                            concerned that the new idea works to solve a problem or achieve a goal than they are with
                            being right themselves. <br><br>
                        <li><b>THREE QUALITIES OF GENIUS</b>
                          <p> <br>Geniuses have been studied extensively over the years. One of the most remarkable
                            conclusions the experts have arrived at is that geniuses are not necessarily people with
                            extraordinary high IQs.They are often ordinary people who use their intelligence in a
                            superior way compared to average, or even smarter, people.What this means is that you can
                            function at genius levels if you learn to think the way that geniuses do. <br><br>&nbsp
                            &nbsp &nbsp &nbspGeniuses seem to have three characteristics in common, each of which you
                            can develop and make into a regular part of your thinking. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                            &nbspFirst, geniuses seem to have <i>open minds.</i> They are curious, questioning,
                            flexible, and willing to consider a wide range of possibilities in dealing with a question
                            or problem.This adaptive mind-set is like an open door that allows ideas to blow through
                            from any direction, or source.This is the mind-set of the genius. And you can learn it by
                            practicing it. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspSecond, geniuses seem to approach problems and
                            decisions <i>systematically</i>. They don't throw themselves at a problem like a dog chasing
                            a passing car. Instead, they approach every difficult situation by asking structured
                            questions in a logical order, like solving a problem in math. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                            &nbspThird, geniuses approach problems with a series of <i>questions.</i> Geniuses first
                            ask, <i>''What exactly is the problem?'' and ''Why is this a problem in the first
                              place?''</i> They then ask, <i>''What would be an ideal solution to this problem?''</i>
                            and <i>''What holds us back from achieving such a solution?''</i> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                            &nbspThey ask: <i>Why does this situation exist? How did it happen? What caused it? Where
                              and when did it first occur? Who is involved in it? What are the different ways that we
                              could solve this problem? Of all the different ways, which solution seems to be the most
                              acceptable, all things considered?</i> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe very act of
                            questioning opens your mind and expands your options. It increases your creativity and
                            stimulates your imagination. Questioning enables you to think more effectively about the
                            problem, and ultimately reach a better decision. <br><br>
                        <li><b>JUMPING TO CONCLUSIONS</b>
                          <p> <br>People with <i>mechanical</i> mind-sets tend to jump to conclusions.They see a problem
                            and they immediately decide on a solution.When two events happen close together, they assume
                            that one event is the reason for the second event. They <i>confuse correlation with
                              causation.</i> Once they have made a decision, they look for evidence to confirm what they
                            have already decided. Their egos quickly become involved, and they then become reluctant to
                            change their minds. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThere seems to be a direct relationship
                            between the quantity of ideas and approaches you develop to solve a problem and your
                            likelihood of coming up with the best idea that will solve the problem in the very best way.
                            For this reason, you must discipline yourself to resist the temptation to jump to
                            conclusions, or to rush to judgment. You must proceed more slowly, like a genius, and keep
                            asking questions.You must keep your mind open. <br><br>
                        <li><b>CREATIVITY IS YOUR BIRTHRIGHT</b>
                          <p> <br>If the truth were known, you are an idea-generating organism. Creativity is your
                            birthright.You are a highly intelligent individual with a continuous flow of good ideas that
                            you can use to accomplish goals and improve your life. In fact, even if you have not used
                            your creativity for a long time, and most people have not, you can stir it up, like sugar
                            that has sunk to the bottom of a cup of coffee, by stimulating your mind with methods that
                            we will talk about in the next chapter. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThere is a Law of
                            Probabilities that applies to creative thinking and tapping into the powers of your mind.
                            This law says that the more ideas that you are exposed to, the more likely it is that you
                            will be exposed to the right idea, exactly when you need it. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                            &nbspThe most successful people today are those who are constantly exposing themselves to
                            new ideas from a variety of sources. Unsuccessful people, in contrast, are those who
                            continue to recirculate the same tired old ideas with little imagination or creativity.
                            <br><br>
                        <li><b>LOOK FOR IDEAS EVERYWHERE</b>
                          <p> <br>When you attend a seminar or a lecture given by an expert who is sharing some of the
                            most current ideas in his or her field, you will often receive a bombardment of new insights
                            that you can use to improve parts of your life. Many people's lives have been completely
                            changed as the result of attending a single lecture given by a single intelligent person who
                            gave them a single insight that was the key to their future. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                            &nbspImagine what would happen if you attended courses, seminars, and lectures on a regular
                            basis.You would be continually bombarding your mind with new ideas that would keep your mind
                            alert and aware, and keep your creative juices flowing. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                            &nbspCreative people are constantly reading, not only in their own fields but in other
                            fields as well. They read primarily nonfiction. They subscribe to a variety of magazines and
                            newspapers. They are continually scanning through the tables of contents and through the
                            critical articles. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAlways read with a pen or highlighter in
                            your hand. Even better, learn how to speed-read so that you can scan material at a thousand
                            words a minute, or faster. Speed-reading is a skill, like riding a bicycle, that anyone can
                            learn with a few hours of application. Forever after, you will be able to process more
                            information than perhaps you ever imagined possible. <br><br>
                        <li><b>GET AROUND THE RIGHT PEOPLE</b>
                          <p> <br>Effective people make a habit of associating with other positive, creative people.
                            They are constantly sharing ideas and experiences, learning from each other. They cut
                            clippings out of magazines and newsletters, and pass them on to their friends. They
                            recommend books they have read and audio programs they have listened to. Their friends do
                            the same for them. Sometimes one good idea that you get from someone else can change the
                            direction of your life. <br><br>
                        <li><b>A FOOLISH CONSISTENCY</b>
                          <p> <br>The second major factor that holds people back is homeostasis. This is defined as a
                            ''striving for constancy.'' It is a deep desire to remain consistent with what you have done
                            and said in the past. Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote in his essay ''Self-Reliance,'' ''A foolish
                            consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspHe was
                            referring to the natural tendency of individuals to try to remain consistent with previous
                            opinions and behaviors. This form of rigidity blocks off almost all possibilities for growth
                            in the future. To resist the tendency toward homeostasis, you should be willing to abandon
                            your old ideas when someone can prove that there are newer, better ideas available.
                            <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOne way to escape the mental trap of homeostasis is for you
                            to be <i>willing to admit that you are wrong.</i> The mark of the superior person, in a time
                            of rapid change, is to always remain open to the possibility that one's most cherished ideas
                            are incorrect. This takes tremendous courage and maturity. But it stimulates more ideas and
                            insights. <br><br>
                        <li><b>WRONG DECISIONS</b>
                          <p> <br>According to the American Management Association, at least 70 percent of your
                            decisions will turn out to be wrong in the fullness of time. This 70 percent figure is an
                            average. Some people will be wrong even more often. But you can assume, as a rule of thumb,
                            that 7 out of 10 decisions that you make regarding your life and work will turn out to be
                            wrong in the long run. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspHere is a question for you. If 70
                            percent of the decisions that managers and executives make turn out to be wrong, how can the
                            world continue to function? The answer is simple. Superior people - those who rise to the
                            top of any organization - are those who are willing to cut their losses. They are willing to
                            admit quickly that they have made a mistake and rectify the situation rather than persisting
                            until it gets worse. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspUnfortunately, the vast majority of
                            people fall in love with their past decisions, and once having made them, they are reluctant
                            to give them up, even if all the evidence is against them. Don't let this happen to you.
                            Instead, resolve to be the very first to recognize that a decision that you have made or
                            conclusion that you have come to has been invalidated or disproven by new information. Be
                            prepared to drop the old decision and embrace a new solution or new way of doing things.

                        <li><b>FLEXIBILITY GIVES YOU STRENGTH</b>
                          <p> <br>According to the Menninger Institute, the most important quality that you will need to
                            be successful in the twenty-first century is the quality of flexibility, especially in the
                            way you think. Flexibility refers to your willingness to change and try new things. It
                            especially means that you have the ability to continually abandon old, outmoded ideas in
                            favor of new, more effective ideas. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspMany people spend much of
                            their time arguing, rationalizing, and justifying their behaviors. They are determined to
                            continue doing things the same old way even when it is perfectly clear that the old way no
                            longer works.The way to avoid this tendency is to remain flexible, especially when you are
                            most convinced that you are right. <br><br>
                        <li><b>THE MIRACLE OF PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT</b>
                          <p> <br>One of the great turning points in my life came when, as a young man in my early
                            twenties, I discovered the miracle of personal development. My life has never been the same.
                            I learned that through personal development you can indeed pull yourself up by your own
                            bootstraps. I learned that, by learning what you need to learn to achieve the goals you have
                            set for yourself, there are virtually no limits on what you can do, have, or be.
                            <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe truth is that <i>the future belongs to the
                              competent</i>.You could lose all of your money tomorrow, but as long as you still had your
                            ability to think and reason, you could make it all back and more besides. The future belongs
                            to those who are better informed. The future belongs not to those who <i>have more</i>
                            versus those who <i>have less,</i> but to those who <i>know more</i> versus those who
                            <i>know less.</i> <br><br>
                        <li><b>RAPID OBSOLESCENCE</b>
                          <p> <br>Knowledge and information in your field are doubling every two or three years.
                            Whatever information base you have is rapidly becoming obsolete. You must be in the process
                            of continually taking in new information and ideas just to stay even. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                            &nbsp &nbspFortunately, there is a simple, three-part program that you can use to keep
                            yourself ahead of the pack. I have used it and taught it to many thousands of people, and I
                            have files full of letters from people whose entire lives have been changed as a result. The
                            three keys to continuous personal and professional development are <i>continuous reading,
                              continuous listening to audio learning programs, and continuous training.</i> <br><br>
                        <li><b>READ EVERY DAY</b>
                          <p> <br>In order to stay on top of your job, you should read in your field at least one hour
                            per day, underlining and taking good notes. Anything less than one hour per day will put you
                            in danger of being passed by your competitors. My friend Jim Rohn advises, <i>''Work at
                              least as hard on yourself as you do on your job.''</i> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAt
                            the very least, you should get up every morning and read 30 to 60 minutes in something
                            educational.Take careful notes. Review your notes on a regular basis. Reflect on what you
                            have learned, and think about how you could apply the new ideas in your daily life.
                            <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspUse your powers of visualization to imagine yourself using
                            the new information in some way. This will dramatically increase the speed at which you
                            learn and retain the new ideas, and increase the likelihood that you will use them at the
                            first opportunity. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIf you read just one hour per day, that
                            will amount to about one book per week. One book per week will amount to about 50 books per
                            year. Fifty books per year will total about 500 books over the next 10 years. At the very
                            least, you will need a bigger house just to hold your books, and you will probably be able
                            to afford it as well. <br><br>
                        <li><b>GIVE YOURSELF THE EDGE</b>
                          <p> <br>According to the American Booksellers Association, fully 70 percent of American adults
                            have not visited a bookstore in the last five years. The average American reads less than
                            one book per year; 58 percent of adult Americans never read another book from cover to cover
                            after they leave high school. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspMeanwhile, in the information
                            age, if you are not reading continuously you are in serious danger of being made obsolete by
                            the passage of time. However, if you read one hour per day, one book per week, you will be
                            getting the equivalent of a Ph.D. in your field every year.You will become one of the
                            smartest, best-informed, and most productive people in your business. <br><br>
                        <li><b>BEATING THE DRUM</b>
                          <p> <br>Some years ago, I had a good friend who read very little. He was not convinced that
                            reading would make any difference to his life or income. He had gotten out of the habit of
                            reading after he left school. He argued with me that reading wasn't that important.
                            Meanwhile, he struggled to make a living. He was continually frustrated. He was continually
                            losing business to his betterinformed competitors. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspFor almost
                            three years, I kept at him, encouraging him to begin daily reading. Finally, he gave in and
                            began to read each morning, just for a few minutes. He was amazed at how helpful the reading
                            was, and how much more knowledgeable he was when he spoke to his clients. <br><br>&nbsp
                            &nbsp &nbsp &nbspHe soon began reading, as I had recommended, an hour per day, one book per
                            week. Within a year, his income had doubled. After two years, his income doubled again.
                            Today he is one of the highest-paid people in his field. And he is proud to tell me every
                            time I see him that he very seldom meets a client who is as well in formed as he is about
                            their business. And the more he reads, the more competent and confident he becomes. <br><br>
                        <li><b>TO EARN MORE, YOU MUST LEARN MORE</b>
                          <p> <br>The rule is that <i>to earn more, you must learn more.</i>You cannot move ahead in
                            your field further or faster than you are doing today except to the degree to which you
                            learn and practice something new. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe second part of your
                            personal and professional development program consists of audio learning programs. If you
                            travel in your work, you spend between five hundred and one thousand hours per year in your
                            car. If you turn this driving time into learning time, you will get the equivalent of three
                            to six months of 40-hour weeks of additional education, just driving from place to place. I
                            have met countless people who have doubled, tripled, and quadrupled their incomes by the
                            simple act of listening to audio learning programs as they drive around. <br><br>
                        <li><b>TAKE ALL THE TRAINING YOU CAN GET</b>
                          <p> <br>The third key to continuous learning, and to unlocking your mental potential, is for
                            you to take all the training you can get. If a training program is offered in the public
                            arena, it has already been proven to be highly effective. The person presenting the program
                            has probably acquired many years of experience, and may have spent hundreds of hours
                            assembling the program that you can take in a half or a full day.You can sometimes save
                            yourself weeks, months, and even years of hard work by attending a seminar given by an
                            expert who explains to you state-of-the-art ways to get your job done faster and easier.

                        <li>
                          <p> <br>When you combine these three: regular reading, regular listening to audio learning
                            programs, and regular and continuous training, you have a dynamite combination that can
                            propel you forward at a greater speed than you ever could without them. <br><br>
                        <li><b>KNOWLEDGE IS POWER</b>
                          <p> <br>As mentioned earlier, Francis Bacon said that knowledge is power. This is only
                            partially true. In fact, only knowledge that can be applied to practical purposes for
                            someone else is actually power. The libraries are full of knowledge that does no one any
                            good. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspTo change your thinking in a positive and constructive

                              <p> <br>Every change in your life will come about as the result of your mind colliding
                                with a new idea. Ideas are the keys to the future. Ideas contain the answers to all of
                                your problems and the ways to achieve all of your goals.Your need is to become an idea
                                generator, so that you are continually coming up with new and better ideas to deal with
                                the continuous changes and opportunities taking place around you. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                &nbsp &nbspFortunately, you are naturally creative. It is an innate quality. You are
                                born with it. But creativity is subject to the Law of Use, which says, <i>''If you don't
                                  use it, you lose it,''</i> at least temporarily. The good news is that you can

                            <li><b>PROJECT FORWARD AND THINK BACKWARD</b>
                              <p> <br>Changing your thinking requires that you expand your ideas and imagination about
                                the person you could be, the things you could do, and the things that you could have.
                                Every person who accomplishes anything worthwhile in life begins with a big dream or a
                                vision of what is possible for him or her.They rise above their current surroundings,
                                their existing limitations and problems, and instead they imagine themselves sometime in
                                the future living the kind of life they would like to live.You need to practice this way
                                of thinking as well. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspEarlier, we talked about your
                                <i>ideal future vision.</i>You create this by projecting forward five years and
                                imagining that all of your dreams have come true. What would your life look like if it
                                were ideal in every way? Where would you be? Who would be there with you? What would you
                                be doing? How much would you be earning? And so on. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYou
                                then return to the present day and your current situation. You think of specific steps
                                you could take to capitalize on your opportunities and to overcome your limitations and
                                obstacles. This is the primary use of creative thinking. It is to solve your problems
                                and trigger mental breakthroughs that you can use to move faster toward achieving the
                                goals that are most important to you. <br><br>
                            <li><b>THREE MINDS IN ONE</b>
                              <p> <br>You think and operate your life with three different minds. The first is your
                                <i>conscious</i> mind.You use your conscious mind to take in new information, compare it
                                with your current knowledge, analyze it in terms of its value or relevance to you, and
                                then decide to act or not to act. This is the mind with which you direct your life. This
                                is often referred to as the <i>objective</i> mind. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe
                                second mind you use is your <i>subconscious.</i> Your subconscious mind is a huge data
                                bank that records every thought, idea, emotion, or experience that you ever have
                                throughout your life.This is called the <i>subjective</i> mind. Its role is to keep all
                                of your words and actions consistent with your self-concept and with your current
                                attitudes, beliefs, fears, and prejudices. Your subconscious mind does not reason; it
                                only obeys your commands. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYour subconscious mind is also
                                responsible for the operation of all of your bodily functions. It controls your
                                autonomic nervous system and your heart rate, breathing, digestion, basic memory, and so
                                on. It is like a huge computer, so powerful and precise that it can process a hundred
                                million commands per second. It maintains a precise balance of hundreds of chemicals in
                                each one of your billions of cells, 24 hours a day. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYour
                                third mind is your <i>superconscious</i> mind. This mind is your direct connection with
                                infinite intelligence. It contains all knowledge, and can bring you all the ideas and
                                answers you will ever need to achieve any goal that you can set for yourself. This mind
                                is the source of all inspiration, imagination, intuition, and hunches. It operates 24
                                hours a day, and will bring you exactly the right answer to your problem or question,
                                exactly when you are ready for it. It is stimulated by clear goals, vivid mental
                                pictures, and clear, positive commands in the form of affirmations. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                &nbsp &nbspWhen you use all three minds in harmony, with each mind performing the
                                functions for which it was designed, you will accomplish more of your goals, faster than
                                you have ever imagined. The proper utilization of your three minds is central to your
                                changing your thinking and changing your life. <br><br>
                            <li><b>THREE TRIGGERS TO CREATIVITY</b>
                              <p> <br>There are three main factors that trigger creativity.You can use each of them
                                regularly, in everything you do. They are: first, <i>intensely desired goals;</i>
                                second, <i>pressing problems;</i> and third, <i>focused questions</i>. When you use them
                                all, you begin to generate ideas at a rate that will amaze you. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                &nbsp &nbspBy using these three methods of mental stimulation - goals, problems and
                                questions - you activate all three of your minds simultaneously and you begin to
                                function at much higher levels than the average person. <br><br>
                            <li><b>INTENSELY DESIRED GOALS</b>
                              <p> <br>The first factor is a clearly defined, <i>intensely desired goal.</i> You must
                                know exactly what you want, set a deadline, make it measurable, and develop a plan for
                                its achievement that you work on every day.There is a direct relationship between how
                                clear you are about your desired goal and how many ideas you will come up with to
                                achieve it. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOne of the most powerful ways to harmonize
                                the activities of your three minds, and to activate your creative powers, is for you to
                                rewrite your goals in the present tense each morning. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspGet
                                a spiral notebook. Each morning, after your daily reading, take a few minutes and
                                rewrite your major goals in the present tense, exactly as if they already existed. Take
                                a few seconds after rewriting each goal to visualize it as though it were already
                                accomplished. See each goal in your mind as if it already existed. Then, smile, relax,
                                and let go. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThis method of rewriting your goals each
                                morning, visualizing them as if they had already been achieved, and them letting them go
                                with complete confidence is a vital part of creating the mental equivalent of the things
                                you want. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspBy using this method, you will help your goals
                                to materialize exactly when you are ready for them. By writing and rewriting your goals,
                                you burn them deeper and deeper into your subconscious mind. At a certain point, you
                                activate your superconscious mind. At that point, you begin attracting into your life
                                people and circumstances that can help you to achieve them. <br><br>
                            <li><b>GET THE FEELING</b>
                              <p> <br>Emotion is the key. The more intensely you desire a goal, the more rapidly it
                                materializes. Combining your idea of your goal with the intense emotion of desire or
                                excitement is like stepping on the accelerator of your mental potential.Your mind will
                                speed up and generate ideas for goal accomplishment. The more positive, excited, and
                                enthusiastic you are about achieving anything, the more rapidly your mind goes to work
                                to bring it into your life. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThink about how you would
                                feel if you had achieved your goal. Would you feel proud, happy, relieved, joyous, or
                                exhilarated? Whatever the emotion would be, you should confidently and happily imagine
                                yourself enjoying the exact feeling that you would have if your goal were already a part
                                of your life. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIf you want to earn more money and achieve
                                a higher standard of living, imagine that you are already there, living the life you
                                desire. Imagine how you would feel. Close your eyes and <i>get the feeling</i> of
                                happiness, joy, and inner satisfaction. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen you can
                                combine a clear mental picture of your goal with the same emotion that you would have if
                                it were achieved, you activate your higher powers of mind.You trigger your creativity.
                                You get insights and ideas that will help you to achieve your goal far faster. <br><br>
                            <li><b>PROBLEMS AS OPPORTUNITIES</b>
                              <p> <br>The second factor that triggers your creativity and activates your positive mind
                                is <i>pressing problems</i>. It is only when you are experiencing the pressure of
                                problems and obstacles that you are motivated to perform at your mental best. Facing and
                                solving the inevitable problems and difficulties of life make you stronger and smarter,
                                and bring out the very best in you. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspMost people do not
                                understand the nature of problems. Problems are a normal and necessary part of life.They
                                are inevitable and unavoidable. Problems come in spite of your best efforts to avoid
                                them. Problems, therefore, come unbidden. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe only part
                                of a problem over which you have any control is your response to your problems.
                                Effective people respond positively and constructively to problems. In this way, they
                                demonstrate that they have developed high levels of ''response-ability.'' They have
                                developed the ability to respond effectively when unexpected or undesired difficulties
                                occur. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspProblems of all kinds bring out your very best
                                qualities. They make you strong and resourceful. The more pressing your problems, and
                                the more emotion you invest in solving those problems, the more creative you will
                                become. Each time you solve a problem constructively, you become smarter and more
                                effective. As a result, you prepare yourself for even bigger and more important problems
                                to solve. <br><br>
                            <li><b>THINK ON PAPER</b>
                              <p> <br>One way to improve your ability to solve problems, and to trigger your creativity,
                                is for you to think on paper.Take a few moments to ask, <i>''What exactly is the
                                  problem?''</i> Then write the answer down in such a form that it describes the problem
                                exactly. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYou can then ask, <i>''What else is the
                                  problem?''</i> You should beware of any problem for which there is only one
                                definition. The worst thing you can do is to solve the wrong problem. The more different
                                ways that you can state a problem, the more amenable it becomes to a solution.
                                <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhatever difficulties, obstacles, challenges, or factors
                                that are hindering you or holding you back in any way, define them clearly in writing.
                                As they say in medicine, <i>''Accurate diagnosis is half the cure.''</i> <br><br>&nbsp
                                &nbsp &nbsp &nbspSometimes, when you begin to define a problem, you will find that it is
                                actually a ''cluster problem.'' That is, it is a single large problem surrounded by
                                several smaller problems. Most problems you deal with will be composed of several
                                smaller problems. Often in a difficult situation, there is one large problem that must
                                be solved before any of the smaller problems can be solved. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                &nbspThe best approach to this type of situation is for you to determine the main
                                problem and then define the individual parts of the problem separately.You identify the
                                core problem that must first be solved and then deal with the smaller problems in order.
                                Sometimes solving one part of the problem leads to the resolution of the entire
                                situation. <br><br>
                            <li><b>GOALS ARE JUST PROBLEMS</b>
                              <p> <br>A goal that you have not yet achieved is merely a problem that you have not yet
                                solved.This is why success has been defined as <i>the ability to solve problems.</i> If
                                you are not earning the kind of money that you would like, that is an unsolved problem.
                                If you are not enjoying the levels of health and fitness that you desire, this is just a
                                problem that you must solve. An obstacle that stands between you and your goal is merely
                                a problem waiting for a solution. Any limitation that is holding you back is just
                                another problem waiting for you to solve. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn every case,
                                your job is to not let the problem get on top of you, but rather for you to get on top
                                of the problem. <br><br>
                            <li><b>YOUR JOB DESCRIPTION</b>
                              <p> <br>If I asked you what you did for a living, you would tell me the name of your
                                current position or job description. But whatever your title, your real job is ''problem
                                solver.'' This is what you do all day long. It is this ability that makes you valuable.
                                You are a professional problem solver.Your success in your career is determined by how
                                effectively you solve the problems and achieve the goals of your position. <br><br>&nbsp
                                &nbsp &nbsp &nbspNever complain about your problems at work.You should be grateful for
                                them. If you had no problems at work, you would have no job. When people become unable
                                to solve the problems that arise in their work, they are quickly replaced by people who
                                can. When you become an excellent problem solver, you are quickly promoted to solving
                                even bigger and more important problems. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspFrom now on, see
                                yourself as a problem solver. The only question is, <i>how good are you at your job?</i>
                                Your goal is to become absolutely excellent at solving any problem that the world can
                                throw at you. <br><br>
                            <li><b>ASK FOCUSED QUESTIONS</b>
                              <p> <br>The third way to activate your creativity is by asking <i>focused questions.</i>
                                Well-worded, focused, provocative, challenging questions activate your mind and
                                stimulate your thinking. The very best consultants often describe themselves as
                                ''insultants.'' They don't give answers. They instead force their clients to ask and
                                answer tough questions. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspTo trigger your own creativity,
                                you have to ask yourself some tough questions as well, and then question your answers.
                                <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspRemember zero-based thinking? Keep asking yourself, ''If
                                I were not now doing this, would I start it over again today knowing what I now
                                know?''You will be amazed at how creative you become when you examine every aspect of
                                your life as though you could choose to start it again, if you wanted to, based on your
                                present knowledge and experience. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOften, the answer to
                                your biggest dilemma is simply to <i>discontinue</i> an activity altogether. If it's not
                                working out, sometimes the smartest thing you can do is to simply abandon a particular
                                course of action. Always ask, <i>''What is the simplest and most direct solution to this
                                  problem?''</i> <br><br>
                            <li><b>CLARITY IS EVERYTHING</b>
                              <p> <br>There are additional questions that you can ask to trigger your creativity - for
                                example, <i>''What am I trying to do?''</i> Be absolutely clear about your answer to
                                this question. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhenever you experience any frustration or
                                resistance in achieving a goal or getting a result, ask yourself, <i>''How am I trying
                                  to do it?''</i> and <i>''Could there be a better way?''</i> Don't fall in love with
                                your current methods. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhat are your assumptions? What are
                                your obvious <i>assumptions</i> and what are your unconscious assumptions? What are you
                                assuming to be true that if it were not true, your thinking would change altogether?
                                Alex McKenzie wrote, ''Errant assumptions lie at the root of every failure.'' <br><br>
                            <li><b>THE REAL PROBLEM</b>
                              <p> <br>I often work with companies that are trying to market a new product or service and
                                they are having difficulties in the marketplace. When we seek the reasons for their
                                business problems, they usually give me long lists of difficulties with advertising,
                                promotion, people, sales, distribution, delivery, and service. However, the core problem
                                is always that their <i>sales are not high enough.</i> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspI
                                then ask them three questions. They are questions that you can ask when considering any
                                potential product or service for any market. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe first
                                question is, <i>''Is there a market?''</i> Are there people who can and will buy this
                                product or service in competition with other products and services currently being
                                offered? Many people start businesses without realizing how hard it is to attract a
                                customer away from another supplier if the customer is currently happy with the other
                                vendor. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIf the company's answer is, <i>''Yes, there is
                                  definitely a market for what we sell. There are people who want it and are willing to
                                  buy it from us,''</i> my next question is then, ''Is the market large enough?'' Many a
                                product or service is good, valuable, and worthwhile, but there is not a large enough
                                market to justify investing all the time and energy necessary to bring it to the market.
                                There are better and more profitable uses for the money. <br><br>
                            <li><b>WHY COMPANIES FAIL</b>
                              <p> <br>Many people go broke, especially in entrepreneurial ventures, because the market
                                is simply not large enough for them to sell enough to justify the trouble and expense of
                                producing the product or service in the first place. Every investment must be compared
                                with other possible investments that are available at the same time.There may be better
                                places to put your time and money. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThis principle applies
                                to you personally, as well.Your job is to invest yourself so that you are getting the
                                highest ''return on energy.'' There are a thousand different ways that you can spend
                                your time and your life.You yourself are your most valuable resource, and you must
                                always invest this resource where you can get the highest return. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                &nbsp &nbspThe third question I ask my clients is, <i>''If there is a market, and the
                                  market is large enough, is the market concentrated enough so that you can advertise
                                  and sell to it in a cost-effective way?''</i> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThis
                                final question is what often sinks a new product idea.Yes, there is a market, and yes,
                                the market is large enough, but the market is spread over such a wide geographical area
                                that it is virtually impossible to sell to it effectively. <br><br>
                            <li><b>CONSIDER THE CONSTRAINTS</b>
                              <p> <br>A good way to trigger creative solutions to your problems is to apply the ''theory
                                of constraints.''This theory says that, in every process or series of activities, there
                                is a <i>limiting factor</i>. There are constraints or bottlenecks that determine the
                                speed at which you get from where you are to where you want to go.The very act of
                                identifying the critical constraints in your environment often triggers ideas and
                                insights that help you to alleviate them. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspFor example,
                                let us say that your goal is to double your income over the next three to five years.
                                You begin identifying the constraints on achieving this goal by asking, <i>''Why isn't
                                  my income twice as high already?''</i> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspBe honest. Ask
                                yourself the brutal questions:Why aren't you already earning twice as much as you are
                                earning today? What is holding you back? Of all the things that are holding you back,
                                what is the major limiting factor that will determine how fast you achieve your goal?
                                <br><br>
                            <li><b>APPLY THE 80/20 RULE</b>
                              <p> <br>The 80/20 Rule seems to apply to constraints, but in a special way. In this
                                context, this rule says that 80 percent of the constraints that are holding you back
                                from achieving your goal are <i>inside</i> yourself. They are contained within you,
                                rather than in your environment. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOnly 20 percent of the
                                factors that are holding you back are in the <i>outside</i> world. This discovery is a
                                shock to most people.The vast majority of people think that their major problems are
                                created or caused by situations and people around them. But this is usually untrue. Most
                                of the reasons why you are not moving ahead have to do with your own lack of skills,
                                ability, or good personal qualities. <br><br>
                            <li><b>DOUBLE YOUR INCOME</b>
                              <p> <br>Let us say that you are in sales.You want to double your income in the next three
                                to five years, if not sooner.The first critical constraint you will identify is the
                                amount of your product or service that you have to sell. If you could resolve this
                                problem, you would achieve your goal.n <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOnce you have
                                identified this main constraint, you then ask, ''What is the constraint behind
                                that?''Your next constraint could be the number of prospects that you have to find. If
                                you could speak to enough prospects, you could probably double your sales and double
                                your income. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYou then look behind that constraint and ask
                                what is the constraint that is causing this limitation. This actual constraint may be
                                your ability to prospect, something that is inside of you rather than in the
                                marketplace. <br><br>
                            <li><b>LOOK AROUND YOU</b>
                              <p> <br>One good way for you to determine whether the constraint is internal or external
                                is to look around you and see if anyone else is accomplishing the same goals that you
                                want to accomplish. Is anyone else already earning twice as much as you are earning
                                selling the same product or service in the same market? If someone is already doing it,
                                then the constraint is <i>internal</i>, not external. It is something inside you. It is
                                the lack of a particular ability or attribute that you need to overcome. <br><br>&nbsp
                                &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIt has been said, <i>''When a man's fight begins with himself, he is
                                  really worth something.''</i> The superior person always asks the question, <i>''What
                                  is it in me that is holding me back?''</i> Superior people always look to themselves
                                first. It may very well be that there is something in your outside world that is acting
                                as the brake on your potential, but the place to start looking is inside. The odds are
                                you'll find it there. <br><br>
                            <li><b>PULL THE TRIGGERS</b>
                              <p> <br>When you pull these triggers regularly, you will be stimulating your creative
                                ability and switching on your mental lights, like turning up the lights in a dark room
                                with a dimmer switch. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen you set clear goals that you
                                have a burning desire to achieve, you activate your creative mind. When you combine your
                                goals with pressing problems, clearly defined, you generate more ideas. When you
                                continually ask focused questions that provoke your thinking, you see more and better
                                possibilities in every situation. And when you identify your key constraint to achieving
                                any goal or solving any problem, you begin to perform like a genius.You put yourself
                                onto the high road of success and great achievement. <br><br>

                                schooling, you were tested only on the basis of your verbal and mathematical
                                intelligences. But research in the past few years indicates that you have a variety of
                                intelligences, in any one of which you could be a genius; in combination, they enable
                                you to accomplish extraordinary things.Your first job is to identify your predominant
                                intelligence or intelligences; you then apply yourself using more of that intelligence
                                in whatever it is you are trying to achieve. <br><br>
                            <li><b>VERBAL INTELLIGENCE</b>
                              <p> <br>Your first intelligence is verbal. This is your ability to speak, your command of
                                language. The ability to understand and to use language well is closely associated with
                                success in any field that involves communication with others. In every society, there is
                                a direct relationship between your level of fluency in your language and your income.You
                                can actually increase your prospects and your rate of promotion just by learning and
                                using more words. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspEach word is actually a tool for the
                                expression of thought. The more words you know and understand, the more complex thoughts
                                and ideas you can form. The better your vocabulary, the more respected and listened to
                                by others you will be. This is why language skills are considered a key measure of
                                intelligence. <br><br>
                            <li><b>MATHEMATICAL INTELLIGENCE</b>
                              <p> <br>The second intelligence used to measure IQ is mathematical. This is your ability
                                to use numbers skillfully, to add, subtract, divide, and multiply. In business, this is
                                your ability to read financial statements and develop financial projections. The more
                                knowledgeable you are about prices, costs, expenses, and financial ratios, the better
                                decisions you can make, and the more valuable you become. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                &nbspMany people feel that they have no ability for numbers. They therefore avoid any
                                area or activity where financial fluency is necessary for success. This can be fatal if
                                one of your goals is to achieve financial independence. Fortunately, you can learn to
                                understand the critical numbers in your business with a little study and application. As
                                a result, you will be far more competent and capable of making good decisions for the
                                rest of your business life. <br><br>
                            <li><b>PHYSICAL INTELLIGENCE</b>
                              <p> <br>Your third area of potential genius is physical intelligence. This is the kind of
                                intelligence enjoyed by top athletes who have extraordinary abilities of timing and
                                coordination in the movement and use of their bodies. A person could fail in school on
                                verbal and mathematical tests and still be an extraordinary success athletically, even
                                though it would never show up on a report card. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspMany
                                people sell themselves short by believing that they are not particularly capable at
                                sports or certain physical activities.The good news is that with proper instruction and
                                practice you can perform quite well in a variety of sports, such as swimming, skating,
                                or skiing. It is really only a question of desire on your part.You have far more
                                physical ability than you have ever used before. <br><br>
                            <li><b>MUSICAL INTELLIGENCE</b>
                              <p> <br>Your fourth form of intelligence can be musical. A Mozart or a Beethoven could
                                have been poor at sports and poor in school and yet capable of composing some of the
                                most beautiful classical music of all time. Many of the top musicians and popular
                                singers today did poorly in school but turned out to have an exceptional ability to
                                create and express music.They were able to perform at outstanding levels musically.
                                <br><br>
                            <li><b>VISUAL-SPATIAL INTELLIGENCE</b>
                              <p> <br>Your fifth area of mental potential is <i>visual-spatial</i> intelligence. This is
                                the ability to see and create shapes, forms, and patterns. An architect, an engineer, a
                                painter, or a person who has developed the capacity to visualize very clearly would have
                                this intelligence. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAn architect, for example, might be
                                able to develop, first in his or her mind and then on paper, beautiful buildings that
                                then people with mathematical intelligence would be able to convert into blueprints and
                                exact dimensions for construction. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThis is also the
                                intelligence you use for visualizing and seeing your goals in your mind's eye before
                                they emerge in your reality. This is an intelligence and an ability that you can develop
                                with practice. <br><br>
                            <li><b>INTERPERSONAL INTELLIGENCE</b>
                              <p> <br>Your sixth form of intelligence is interpersonal. This is the highestpaid form of
                                intelligence in the United States. It is the ability to communicate, negotiate,
                                influence, and persuade other people. It is characterized by a high degree of
                                sensitivity to the thoughts, feelings, motivations, and desires of others. A person with
                                high interpersonal intelligence has the ability to interact with people effectively to
                                get things done. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspSuccessful managers, team leaders, and
                                even military officers usually have interpersonal intelligence developed to a very high
                                degree. As a result, people want to work and cooperate with them in the accomplishment
                                of group goals. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe highest-paid salespeople are those
                                who are excellent at persuading others to purchase their products and services. The most
                                effective businesspeople, consultants, and professionals demonstrate this intelligence
                                constantly. It is the most important single ability of the successful politician. This
                                may be your particular area of genius, as well. <br><br>
                            <li><b>INTRAPERSONAL INTELLIGENCE</b>
                              <p> <br>Your seventh form of intelligence is intrapersonal. This is the ability to be
                                aware of yourself - who you are and who you are not. With this intelligence, you know
                                exactly what you want and what you don't want. You are capable of setting goals for
                                yourself and making plans for their accomplishment. People with high levels of
                                intrapersonal intelligence are good at introspection. They reflect on how they are
                                thinking and feeling. As a result of understanding themselves better, they are more
                                effective in dealing with others. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe greater your level
                                of self-awareness, gained through thought and introspection, the greater your level of
                                <i>self-understanding.</i> The better you understand yourself and why you think and feel
                                the way you do, the greater will be your level of <i>self-acceptance</i>.The more you
                                accept yourself as a valuable and worthwhile person, the more you like and respect
                                yourself. And the more you like yourself, the more you like others and the more they
                                like you. Intrapersonal intelligence is very important to a happy and successful life,
                                and you can develop it with practice. <br><br>
                            <li><b>ENTREPRENEURIAL INTELLIGENCE</b>
                              <p> <br>Your eighth form of intelligence is entrepreneurial. This is the ability to see
                                market opportunities and then to bring the various resources together to produce
                                products and services that can be sold at a profit. Entrepreneurial intelligence is one
                                of the highest-paid forms of intelligence in our society today, and is the foundation of
                                all successful, fast-growing businesses. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspMost self-made
                                millionaires and many self-made billionaires started with nothing and made their money
                                by applying their entrepreneurial intelligence to market opportunities that appeared
                                before them. Bill Gates dropped out of Harvard to start Microsoft with an idea to
                                develop software for the emerging market in personal computers. Michael Dell began
                                assembling personal computers in his dorm room at college. They had high levels of
                                entrepreneurial intelligence. You probably do as well. <br><br>
                            <li><b>INTUITIVE INTELLIGENCE</b>
                              <p> <br>Your ninth form of intelligence is <i>intuitive.</i> This is the ability to sense
                                the rightness or wrongness of a situation, to judge people quickly and accurately, and
                                to come up with ideas and insights separately from your logic or training. <br><br>&nbsp
                                &nbsp &nbsp &nbspMany people are great judges of character. They seem to know an
                                enormous amount about a person within just a few seconds of meeting them or even just
                                hearing their voices. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWomen's intuition is more respected
                                than men's. But when men and women are tested and given intuition-dependent questions to
                                answer, men and women score equally well.Why then do we respect women's intuition so
                                much? It is because women themselves listen to and trust their intuition more than men
                                do. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspFortunately, your intuitive intelligence is inborn
                                and can be increased with use. The more you listen to and trust your intuition, the
                                sharper and more accurate it becomes. As you use your intuition more, you will receive
                                more and better answers from it. Author Jane Ponder said that <i>''men and women begin
                                  to become great when they start to listen to their inner voices.''</i> <br><br>
                            <li><b>ABSTRACT INTELLIGENCE</b>
                              <p> <br>Your tenth form of intelligence is abstract, or conceptual intelligence. This is
                                the kind of intelligence possessed by an Einstein who could see himself riding on a beam
                                of light and as a result was able to formulate the theory of relativity, which
                                completely revolutionized the field of physics. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe
                                scientist F. A. Kekule saw a great snake curling back on itself and grasping its own
                                tail. He recognized it as a clue to the ringlike structure of the benzene molecule, a
                                critical discovery for our century. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOften in your life,
                                you will get a sudden idea or picture that combines several factors into a new
                                synthesis. This can turn out to be a new business idea, such as Ray Kroc had when he
                                observed the mass production methods for cooking hamburgers and french fries developed
                                by the McDonald brothers of San Bernardino. With that insight, he started the
                                30,000-unit McDonald's Corporation. <br><br>
                            <li><b>YOUR INTELLIGENCES MAKE YOU UNIQUE</b>
                              <p> <br>Your combination of intelligences makes you a potential genius, and also makes you
                                different from anyone else who has ever lived.Think of yourself this way: Imagine that
                                these 10 intelligences are like the 10 digits from zero through nine. If you take any
                                large city, you will find that there are hundreds of thousands of people with different
                                telephone numbers, even though all of their telephone numbers are made up of an area
                                code plus seven digits. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIf you give yourself a score from
                                zero to nine in each of the 10 intelligences, you will have a 10-digit number that
                                describes your personal combination of intelligences. This unique combination of
                                intelligences forms a kind of personal intellectual telephone number. Your private
                                mental code number makes you different from every other person who has ever lived. Like
                                DNA, the likelihood of someone else having the same intellectual formula as you is
                                billions to one. <br><br>
                            <li><b>APPLYING YOUR INCREDIBLE MIND</b>
                              <p> <br>By developing and exploiting your unique combination of intelligences, you can
                                perform at extraordinary levels. You need to first evaluate your intelligences and then
                                grade yourself in each one.Next, you identify the special areas of intelligence that you
                                enjoy the most, the ones that you have used most successfully in the past. Finally, you
                                look around you and think about what kind of work you could do that would enable you to
                                use your special combination of intelligences at the highest level. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                &nbsp &nbspAbove all, you must develop a greater respect for yourself and your potential
                                brainpower. The psychologist Abraham Maslow estimated that not more that 2 percent of
                                adults were doing all that was possible for them based on their special talents.You must
                                therefore develop a higher level of faith and confidence in your ability to use your
                                mental powers to overcome any obstacle and to achieve any goal that you can set for
                                yourself. <br><br>
                            <li><b>THREE WAYS OF LEARNING</b>
                              <p> <br>You have three ways of learning: auditory, visual, and kinesthetic. You can learn
                                by <i>listening,</i> learn by <i>seeing,</i> or learn by <i>feeling</i> and
                                <i>movement</i>. Each person uses all three modalities to learn, but each person also
                                has what is called a <i>preferred</i> learning style. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                            <li><b>The Visual Learner</b> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspVisuals like to see things
                              clearly in front of them.They process information with their eyes. They have acute senses
                              of sight and like to meet friends and business associates personally. If you give them
                              verbal information on business results, they will ask, ''Do you have that in writing?''
                              <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThey are avid readers. When you quote a book or a magazine,
                              they will want to get a hard copy to read personally. They like to take photographs, and

                            <li><b>The Auditory Learner</b> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAn auditory learner likes to
                              listen to others, to educational audio programs, audio books, music, lectures, speeches,
                              and seminars. They are active conversationalists and prefer to have new ideas and concepts
                              explained to them. If you hand them a written report, they will glance at it and ask,
                              ''What does it say?'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAuditories say things like, ''That
                              sounds good to me,'' and ''I hear what you're saying,'' or ''That doesn't sound right.''
                              <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThey are also sensitive to music, and enjoy high-quality
                              stereo equipment, concerts, CDs, and other sound reproductions. Auditories represent about
                              40 percent of the population. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp

                              just sitting around. They want to be active, to try things out, often ignoring the written
                              instructions (visual) or verbal instructions (auditory). <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                              &nbspYou find kinesthetics in any type of work that requires manual dexterity, such as
                              carpentry, mechanics, construction, and even driving trucks or cars. Athletes are
                              kinesthetics as well. <br><br>

                            <li><b>MINDSTORMING FOR IDEAS</b>
                              <p> <br>The process of ''mindstorming'' is often called the ''20-idea method.'' It is so
                                powerful in generating ideas that when you begin using it your entire life will change.
                                I have taught it to many tens of thousands of people all over the world. Everyone who
                                uses it sees immediate profound improvements in each part of their lives to which this
                                method is applied. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe method is simple, which is
                                probably why it is so powerful. All you need is a blank sheet of paper. At the top of
                                the page, write out your current problem or goal in the form of a question.
                                <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspLet us say that your goal is to double your income over
                                the next two years. Make the question on this goal as specific as possible. The more
                                specific the question, the better your mind can focus on it and the better quality of
                                answers you will generate with this exercise. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspSo instead
                                of writing, ''How can I make more money?'' you would write instead, ''What can I do to
                                double my income over the next 24 months?'' Remember, you write this question at the top
                                of the page. <br><br>
                            <li><b>GENERATE 20 ANSWERS</b>
                              <p> <br>You then discipline yourself to generate at least 20 different answers to that
                                question. Force yourself to write out 20 different things that you could do that would
                                help you to double your income. You can write more than 20 answers, but you must write a
                                minimum of 20. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYour first answers will probably be simple
                                and obvious. You could write, ''work harder,'' ''work longer,'' ''upgrade my
                                education,'' ''improve my skills in specific areas,'' and so on. They will be easy. The
                                next 5 to 10 answers will be harder. The last 10 answers will be excruciatingly
                                difficult, like squeezing water out of a stone. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspBut to
                                get the most out of this exercise, you must force yourself to continue writing until you
                                have answered the question 20 different ways.You can play with these answers if you
                                like. For example, you can write the exact opposite of one of your earlier answers.You
                                can also generate ridiculous answers as well. <br><br>
                            <li><b>THINK OUT OF THE BOX</b>
                              <p> <br>For example, you might write, ''work harder at my current job.'' Your next answer
                                might be, ''work less at my current job.'' Or, ''work harder at a different job.'' Or it
                                may be to create your own job. Or it may be to get a second-income job, or to work
                                part-time in another field. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIf your income depends on
                                selling and your success in selling depends on prospecting, your answer could be to
                                double the number of qualified prospects you see each week. Or it could be to see
                                higher-potential prospects who have the ability to buy twice as much of your product. Or
                                it could be to sell a different product with a higher commission per sale. <br><br>&nbsp
                                &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn any case, the potential answers are limited only by your
                                imagination, and your capacity to generate ideas to help you is, to all intents and
                                purposes, infinite. <br><br>
                            <li><b>THE IMPORTANCE OF ACTION</b>
                              <p> <br>Once you have answered your question with at least 20 answers, go back over your
                                answers and select at least one answer that you are going to take action on immediately.
                                This step is very important! It is your taking action of some kind that keeps the
                                torrent of ideas flowing through your mind. As you take action on one idea, another idea
                                for another action will come to you. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspHere is an exercise
                                you can use to double and triple the impact of the 20-idea method. Once you have
                                generated at least 20 ideas and selected the one idea you are going to implement
                                immediately, you can then perform the 20-idea method on that new idea, generating 20
                                different ways to put that idea to work. <br><br>
                            <li><b>FIRST THING IN THE MORNING</b>
                              <p> <br>If you generate 20 ways to achieve your major goal in the morning before you start
                                out, you will find yourself thinking creatively all day long.Your mind will be sharper
                                and more alert.You will see solutions to problems and obstacles as fast as they come
                                up.You will activate the law of attraction and begin drawing into your life people and
                                resources that can help you to achieve your goal. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIf you
                                practice this exercise each day for five days, you will generate 100 new ideas to help
                                you achieve your goals in the next week. If you then select one idea per day, you will
                                be initiating five ideas per week.That is more ideas than the average person generates
                                in a month, or even a year. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIf you generate 20 ideas per
                                day, 5 days per week, 50 weeks per year, you will come up with an astounding total of
                                5,000 new ideas to improve your life and work each year. If you implement only a single
                                new idea each day, 5 days per week, 50 weeks per year, you will be using 250 ideas per
                                year to help you solve your problems and achieve your goals. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                &nbspThe average person lives with very little creativity. He is usually a victim of
                                <i>psychosclerosis and homeostasis,</i> content to keep on doing the same things in the
                                future that he has done in the past, whether doing so is working or not. When you
                                practice mindstorming on a regular basis, you will soon have so many good ideas that
                                there will not be enough hours in the day to carry them out. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                &nbspMore people have become rich using this 20-idea method than any other method of
                                creative thinking ever discovered. All that is necessary for this method to work is for
                                you to practice it regularly in your own life. All that is required is your willingness
                                to use mindstorming regularly, and then to try out the ideas you generate until this
                                process becomes a normal part of your life. <br><br>
                            <li><b>BRAINSTORMING WITH OTHERS</b>
                              <p> <br>Mindstorming is an exercise that you can do by yourself. Brainstorming is
                                something that you do with others. Brainstorming is a form of mindstorming done in a
                                group, but it has slightly different rules. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspBrainstorming
                                was originally developed by advertising executive Alex Osborn, and was first described
                                in his 1946 book, <i>Applied Imagination.</i> It has since proliferated and is used all
                                over the world, in every type of organization and situation, to generate ideas for a
                                variety of reasons. It is a very simple process to learn and use. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                &nbsp &nbsp
                            <li><b>Six Steps to Brainstorming</b> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp<b>Step One:</b>
                              Assemble the group. The ideal number of people in a brainstorming session is four to
                              seven. Below four, you don't have enough minds to generate a large enough variety of
                              different solutions to the problem. With more than seven people, the group becomes too
                              large for participants to get sufficient opportunity to contribute. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                              &nbsp &nbsp<b>Step Two:</b> Do not permit criticism or ridicule. The essential part of
                              brainstorming is that no evaluation of the ideas takes place during the brainstorming
                              session. The entire focus of the brainstorming session is on generating the greatest
                              quantity of ideas possible within a short period of time. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                              &nbspNothing kills a brainstorming session faster than the tendency of people to criticize
                              the ideas as they are generated. As soon as one person's ideas are criticized, the
                              brainstorming session comes to a halt. No one wants to be criticized. No one wants to be
                              humiliated or ridiculed in front of others.That is why you must concentrate on the
                              quantity of ideas and leave the evaluation of them to another time, or to other people.
                              <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp<b>Step Three:</b> Set a specific time limit. The ideal
                              length for brainstorming sessions ranges from 15 to 45 minutes. One of the jobs of
                              managers and team leaders is to sit their staff down on a regular basis to brainstorm
                              certain problems. Call everyone together and announce that you are going to brainstorm a
                              particular goal or situation for 15 minutes and then everyone is going to go back to
                              work.You'll be amazed at the results. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp<b>Step Four:</b>
                              Select a leader for the group. The leader's job is to encourage everyone to contribute as
                              much as possible. One of the best ways to lead a brainstorming session is to go around the
                              table and encourage each person to contribute an idea - almost like playing cards, where
                              you encourage each person to bet or pass. Once you have gone around the table a couple of
                              times, people will start generating ideas at a rapid rate. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                              &nbsp<b>Step Five:</b> Select someone to keep track of the ideas. A key function in a
                              brainstorming session is that of the recorder. This is the person who writes down the
                              ideas as they are generated. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp<b>Step Six:</b> Be punctual.
                              Start and stop the brainstorming session exactly on time, no matter how well it is going.
                              At the end, you gather up all the ideas and take them away to be evaluated at a later
                              time. <br><br>
                            <li><b>IDEAS ON INDEX CARDS</b>
                              <p> <br>In another type of brainstorming session involving dozens of people, we break the
                                group up and distribute index cards to each subgroup. Each of the smaller groups is
                                assigned to generate ideas in answer to the question or problem. Afterward, the index
                                cards containing the ideas are collected. They are then shuffled and handed out to the
                                subgroups again, completely mixed up. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn the second phase
                                of the exercise, each subgroup is asked to take the ideas on the cards that they have
                                received and evaluate them, rating them in terms of their value prior to reporting back
                                to the overall group. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn a session with 20 or 30 people,
                                two or three hundred ideas will be generated in 30 minutes. When those ideas are
                                gathered, distributed, evaluated, and reported back to the overall group, the results
                                are absolutely astonishing! I have worked with companies that have come up with so many
                                solutions to problems that had been stumping them that they did not have enough hours in
                                the day, or enough people, to take action on more than a small number of them. <br><br>

                              <p> <br>If you are in a good relationship with another person, the two of you can form an
                                excellent ongoing brainstorming team. A husband and wife, or any two people, together
                                can generate a continuous flow of ideas, as long as they do not attempt to evaluate or
                                criticize the ideas at the same time they are generating them. <br><br>
                            <li><b>IDEAS ENERGIZE YOU</b>
                              <p> <br>There are two parts to unlocking your mental potential and harnessing the genius
                                that lies within you.The first is to accept that you are extremely intelligent in your
                                own way. The second is for you to use the methods and techniques described in this
                                chapter until they become second nature to you. Like a muscle that grows and becomes
                                stronger with use, your mental muscles grow and become stronger every time you practice
                                one of these exercises. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThere is something exciting and
                                uplifting about generating ideas that help you to achieve your goals.The more ideas you
                                generate, the more energy and enthusiasm you have. The more energy and enthusiasm you
                                have, the more confident you become that you can achieve any goal you can set for
                                yourself. The more ideas you generate, the faster you change your thinking about what is
                                really possible for you. Eventually, you will reach the point in your own thinking where
                                you will be unstoppable. <br><br><b>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspACTION EXERCISES</b>

                                  <p> <br>The way you think about yourself and your life determines almost everything
                                    that happens to you. Your primary responsibility is to take full control over your
                                    thinking and to keep your words and thoughts clearly focused on the things that you
                                    really want. Simultaneously, you must refuse to think about the things that you
                                    don't want. This simple formula is the real key to health, happiness, and personal
                                    prosperity. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThis chapter is about ''possibility
                                    thinking.'' This is the process of looking at everything that is going on around you
                                    in terms of possibilities and opportunities rather than as difficulties or problems.
                                    Your goal is to make this a habitual way of thinking, and, like all habits, it is
                                    learnable.You can develop it with constant repetition. Eventually, you will become a
                                    completely positive and constructive person in everything you do. <br><br>
                                <li><b>POSITIVE MENTAL ATTITUDE</b>
                                  <p> <br>A positive mental attitude is closely associated with success in every area of
                                    life. The kind of people we like the most and want to associate with tend to be
                                    people who are generally cheerful and optimistic about their work and personal
                                    lives. No one wants to spend time with a negative, pessimistic, complaining person.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspUnfortunately, it is easy to slip into the habit of
                                    criticizing and complaining.We are bombarded continuously with negative information,
                                    from radio, television, newspapers, and magazines and in our daily interactions with
                                    others. It may not be easy to rise above the flood of negativity that engulfs you,
                                    but it is absolutely essential to do so if you want to keep your spirits up and your
                                    mind clear and positive. <br><br>
                                <li><b>RESPOND CONSTRUCTIVELY TO STRESS</b>
                                  <p> <br>A positive mental attitude can be defined as a <i>constructive response to
                                      stress.</i> It doesn't mean that, no matter what happens, you are happy and
                                    cheerful all the time. Having a positive mental attitude instead requires that you
                                    deal with the inevitable problems of your daily life in a more effective way than
                                    the average person. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspStress is inevitable. Problems
                                    are never ending. Failures and disappointments happen to everyone, all the time. The
                                    only thing over which you have any control is how you respond to these stressful
                                    events. If you respond in a positive, constructive way, you will maintain a
                                    generally positive attitude.When your mind is calm and clear, you will be more
                                    creative and alert.You will be more likely to see more ways to solve your problems,
                                    and to keep moving toward accomplishing your goals. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspWhen you respond in a negative or angry way to a problem or difficulty, you
                                    trigger a series of nervous reactions that shut down the most creative parts of your
                                    brain. Instead of going into a ''react and respond'' way of thinking, you develop a
                                    ''fight or flight'' mentality. <br><br>

                                  <p> <br>There is a five-step power process that you can use to keep yourself positive
                                    and to achieve your goals faster. This five-step process brings together several of
                                    the very best techniques ever discovered for permanent mind change. It contains and
                                    illustrates all of the key principles that you need to know to become a highly
                                    effective, positive ''possibility thinker'' in your own life. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspThe five steps are: first, to <i>idealize;</i> second, to
                                    <i>verbalize;</i> third, to <i>visualize;</i> fourth, to <i>emotionalize;</i> and
                                    fifth, to <i>realize.</i> Let me explain how they work one at a time, and then,
                                    altogether. <br><br>
                                <li><b>IMAGINE YOUR PERFECT FUTURE</b>
                                  <p> <br>Perhaps the biggest obstacle to creating a wonderful life is ''selflimiting
                                    beliefs.'' Everyone has them, and some people have so many of them that they are
                                    almost paralyzed when it comes to taking action. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspA
                                    self-limiting belief is an idea you have that you are limited in some way, in terms
                                    of time, talent, intelligence, money, ability, or opportunity. As a result of these
                                    beliefs, most of which are probably not true, you hold yourself back from taking the
                                    steps necessary to create the kind of life you really desire. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspThe way you free yourself from these negative brakes on your potential is
                                    to change your thinking about who you are and what is truly possible for you.You put
                                    aside any thought of limitation and begin to idealize and imagine the kind of life
                                    that you want to have a week, a month, a year, and five years from now, as if
                                    anything was possible. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn <i>idealization,</i> you
                                    consider each of the key areas of your life and imagine what each would look like if
                                    that area of your life were exactly as you would want it to be, in every respect.

                                <li><b>SHOW ME THE MONEY</b>
                                  <p> <br>Start with your income. How much do you want to be earning one, two, three,
                                    and five years from today? Look around you and ask, ''Who else is earning the kind
                                    of money I want to earn, and what are they doing differently from me?'' If you don't
                                    know or you aren't sure, go and ask them. Do your homework. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspWhat knowledge, skills, and abilities would you have to have to be able
                                    to earn that amount? What kind of work would you, or could you, be doing to achieve
                                    that kind of income? What position will you have in your company? How high up will
                                    you have to be in your field or profession? If you are in sales, how much will you
                                    have to be selling, and to whom? <br><br>

                                  <p> <br>Imagine your perfect lifestyle. If you had no limitations at all, how would
                                    you like to live, day in and day out? If you were financially independent, what kind
                                    of home would you like to live in? What kind of car would you want to drive? What
                                    kind of life would you like to provide for your family? What sort of activities
                                    would you like to engage in throughout the week, month, and year? <br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbspHow much time would you want to take off on vacation, and where
                                    would you like to go? What would you like to do? What sort of activities do you most
                                    enjoy? If you were forced to take a month off from work and you had all the money
                                    you needed, how would you spend that time? <br><br>
                                <li><b>FAMILY PLANNING</b>
                                  <p> <br>Involve your family in your design of an ideal lifestyle. Make this an ongoing
                                    part of your relationships.The more people get a chance to discuss a course of
                                    action, the more committed they will be to whatever is finally decided.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspSome time ago, a good friend of mine sat down with
                                    his wife and children to discuss the fact that he was working too much and not
                                    spending enough time with the family.They imagined how they would spend their time
                                    as a family if they had no limitations. Everyone contributed ideas, including the
                                    young children. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAs a result of this exercise, they
                                    made some decisions about both time and lifestyle. They decided to move out of the
                                    city to a larger home with a bigger yard in the country. He reorganized his workweek
                                    so that he worked four days per week in the city, 10 to 12 hours per day, and then
                                    worked only three or four hours on one day in his office at home in the country. He
                                    ended up spending much more time with his family and getting far more satisfaction
                                    out of life. The best part was that both his results and his income actually
                                    increased with this new plan. <br><br>
                                <li><b>TURN YOUR IDEAL INTO REALITY</b>
                                  <p> <br>When you sit down and design your ideal lifestyle, you can then compare it to
                                    what you are doing today and notice the differences. You can then start thinking
                                    about how you could bring your real or current lifestyle closer to your ideal.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen you idealize your income and your lifestyle, you
                                    develop a vision for your life.You begin to practice a key quality of personal
                                    leadership.You begin projecting into the future and making plans to turn your future
                                    dreams into a current reality. <br><br>
                                <li><b>HEALTH AND FITNESS</b>
                                  <p> <br>You should idealize about your health, as well. Imagine your health was
                                    perfect in every way. How would you be different from today? Exactly how much do you
                                    want to weigh, and what level of fitness do you want to enjoy? How does that compare
                                    with where you are today? What steps will you have to take, and what changes will
                                    you have to make in your health habits in order to become the ideal person that you
                                    desire to be personally? This description then becomes your ideal future vision for
                                    yourself. <br><br>
                                <li><b>THE PERSON YOU BECOME</b>
                                  <p> <br>Create an ideal future self in terms of your personal and professional
                                    development.What kind of a person do you want to be in the future? What additional
                                    knowledge and skills do you want to acquire? In what areas would you like to become

                                <li><b>YOUR MISSION STATEMENT</b>
                                  <p> <br>When you conduct personal strategic planning for yourself, you always begin
                                    with a <i>mission statement.</i>This is clear definition of exactly what you want to
                                    be and accomplish at some future date. To develop your mission statement, you
                                    project forward and imagine that you have been completely successful in achieving
                                    all your goals in a particular area.You then describe your life and activities in
                                    this area exactly as if they were already true today. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspFor example, your personal mission statement could be something like: <i>''I am
                                      a happy, healthy, positive person who does excellent work, is paid extremely well,
                                      is highly respected by his customers and coworkers, and is deeply loved by his
                                      family.''</i> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThis kind of mission statement can
                                    then serve as an organizational blueprint for your life. You can use it to make
                                    decisions by comparing what you are about to do to see if it is consistent with your
                                    mission. If it is not consistent with your mission, or with your ideal image of the
                                    very best person you could possible be, you would not do it. <br><br>
                                <li><b>A BENCHMARK FOR DECISION MAKING</b>
                                  <p> <br>I conducted a strategic planning session for a large corporation not long ago.
                                    The executives had more than 250 potential projects on their drawing boards. After
                                    we had defined the values, vision, and ideal mission of the company, they were
                                    immediately able to discard more than 200 of those potential projects. It was clear
                                    to everyone at the meeting that these projects were not consistent with who they
                                    were as a company and where they wanted to be in the future. This can work for you
                                    as well. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOne of your problems today is that you are
                                    overwhelmed with too much to do and too little time. You have too many things to
                                    think about.You are swamped by too many problems, possibilities, and opportunities.
                                    When you idealize and become crystal clear about what your perfect life would look
                                    like sometime in the future, you will immediately start to make better choices in
                                    your day-to-day activities.You will immediately begin eliminating activities that
                                    are not consistent with where you really want to end up. <br><br>
                                <li><b>A KEY TO HAPPINESS</b>
                                  <p> <br>A clear definition of your ideal, in any area of your life that is important
                                    to you, is the starting point of making better decisions in the present that will
                                    lead to greater success and happiness in the future. As you feel yourself moving
                                    toward the achievement of a worthy ideal, you will feel happier and more confident.
                                    The more progress you make toward a clear goal or set of ideal conditions, the more
                                    energy and enthusiasm you will have. <br><br>
                                <li><b>THE DEFINITION OF INTELLIGENCE</b>
                                  <p> <br>Some years ago, the Gallup organization interviewed 1,500 very successful men
                                    and women in a search for some of the common denominators of success. But when they
                                    asked them to define ''intelligence,'' they got an unexpected answer. <br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe top people in the survey defined intelligence not so much as IQ
                                    or good grades in school, but more as a <i>way of acting.</i> Intelligent behavior
                                    was defined as doing only those things that moved them toward their goals. They
                                    defined intelligence as the ability to systematically eliminate those time-consuming
                                    activities that did not help them to achieve their goals, or even worse, moved them
                                    <i>away</i> from their goals. <br><br>
                                <li><b>GET SMART</b>
                                  <p> <br>Whenever you are doing something that is moving you in the direction of your
                                    own self-professed goals and ideals, you are acting intelligently. This is true
                                    irrespective of your education or your IQ. This is why there are many people of
                                    average intelligence or who did poorly in school who are accomplishing far more than
                                    people with university degrees. These high achievers focus more and more of their
                                    time and energy on activities aimed at accomplishing only those goals that are most
                                    important to them. <br><br>
                                <li><b>PUT IT IN WORDS</b>
                                  <p> <br>The second part of this five-step process is for you to verbalize clearly the
                                    person you want to be, the things you want to do, and the goals you want to
                                    achieve.You verbalize with positive affirmations. Because you can completely
                                    reprogram your subconscious mind with affirmations, by using them repeatedly you
                                    will find that your potential is unlimited. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe Law
                                    of Subconscious Activity says that whatever you repeat over and over to yourself in
                                    your conscious mind will eventually be accepted by your subconscious mind. Once your
                                    subconscious mind accepts your conscious thoughts as commands, it passes them on to
                                    your superconscious mind, which then works 24 hours a day to bring those goals into
                                    your life. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWith positive affirmations, you can take
                                    full control over the content of your conscious and subconscious minds.You can
                                    activate all your mental powers. You can tap into a great universal mind that can
                                    help you to move more rapidly toward your goals of higher income, better health and
                                    relationships, and greater success in your field. <br><br>
                                <li><b>THE THREE Ps OF POSITIVE PROGRAMMING</b>
                                  <p> <br>A positive affirmation is phrased using the ''three Ps.'' This means that for
                                    maximum effectiveness, an affirmation should be <i>personal, positive,</i> and
                                    stated in the <i>present tense.</i> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYour subconscious
                                    mind is like a special computer. It can be accessed and activated only with words
                                    and commands that are presented in a specific language. It accepts only positive
                                    commands that are phrased in the personal, present tense, as though the goal has
                                    already been achieved. It knows no past or future tense. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspMy favorite affirmation is, <i>''I like myself!''</i> repeated over and over
                                    again in a spirit of complete confidence. When you repeat, ''I like myself!''
                                    several times per day, you send this message deep into your subconscious mind. The
                                    more you like yourself, the higher will be your self-esteem. The higher your
                                    self-esteem, the better you will perform in every area of your life. The more you
                                    like yourself, the better you will do, and the better you do, the more you will like
                                    yourself. <br><br>
                                <li><b>BECOME YOUR OWN CHEERLEADER</b>
                                  <p> <br>To improve your performance in your work, or in any other area requiring skill
                                    or ability, continually repeat the words, <i>''I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the
                                      best!''</i> By talking to yourself as if you were already the person you want to
                                    be sometime in the future, you become your own cheerleader.You will then find
                                    yourself doing better and better at whatever you attempt. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspAnother powerful affirmation you can repeat every morning before you start off
                                    is, <i>''I love my work!''</i> Sometimes when you wake up in the morning, you won't
                                    feel particularly excited about the coming day. But you can take control over your
                                    mind and emotions by repeating, ''I love my work!'' until it actually feels true.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspEven better, you can start every day with the words,
                                    <i>''I like myself and I love my work!''</i> This affirmation, repeated
                                    enthusiastically several times every morning, will rev you up and get you excited
                                    about getting to your job. <br><br>
                                <li><b>CONTROL YOUR SELF-TALK</b>
                                  <p> <br>Fully 95 percent of your emotions are determined by the way you <i>talk</i> to
                                    yourself. Dr. Martin Seligman's book <i>Learned Optimism</i> says that your
                                    ''explanatory style'' is the critical factor in determining whether you are a
                                    positive or negative person. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYour explanatory style
                                    is defined as how you explain things to yourself. If you explain or interpret things
                                    to yourself in a positive way, you will be positive. If you explain them in a
                                    negative way, you will be negative.What Seligman concluded is that optimistic
                                    people, when something goes wrong, always explain the event or experience to
                                    themselves as though it were a temporary, specific situation, rather than a
                                    long-term, general condition. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspImagine that you make a
                                    sales call and the prospect is not interested in what you are selling. It didn't
                                    work out. It was a waste of time. If you are a positive person, you will say
                                    something like, ''Well, it's just one sales call.'' This makes it temporary. You
                                    will say, ''The customer is probably having a bad day.'' This makes it specific. You
                                    then say, ''I'll be more successful on the next call.'' This focuses you on the
                                    future. When you dismiss temporary setbacks in this way, you keep your mind
                                    positive.You remain confident and optimistic. <br><br>
                                <li><b>DON'T TAKE THINGS PERSONALLY</b>
                                  <p> <br>When negative people experience problems, setbacks, or difficulties, they
                                    interpret them differently from confident, optimistic people. When they fail
                                    temporarily, which is inevitable, they immediately interpret this as a personal
                                    statement about their deficiencies. If the sales call is not successful, they say,
                                    ''I must be a terrible salesperson. The product is no good. Customers are not
                                    interested in what we have to sell. I'll never succeed in this field.''
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn other words, they overgeneralize and overdramatize
                                    a small failure rather than dismissing it as a temporary setback and going on to the
                                    next call. They interpret the experience negatively. It then has a negative effect
                                    on their self-image: ''I'm no good.'' Their work performance declines and they do
                                    even worse next time. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe good news, however, is that
                                    how you interpret an event is under your control. It is a matter of choice.You
                                    determine how you are going to feel and react by how you choose to explain a
                                    situation to yourself. Choose to put a positive spin on it, whatever it is.You are
                                    in charge. <br><br>
                                <li><b>MAKE IT SIMPLE</b>
                                  <p> <br>When you verbalize your goals in the form of positive affirmations, you should
                                    use words that your subconscious can easily understand and go to work on. Make your
                                    statements simple and practical. For example, ''I like myself'' is personal. ''I'm
                                    the best'' is personal and positive. And ''I love my work'' is personal, positive,
                                    and in the present tense. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThese are the kinds of
                                    affirmations that are immediately accepted by your subconscious mind as
                                    commands.They have an immediate impact on how you think and feel about yourself.
                                    They instantly boost your self-esteem and self-confidence.To remain optimistic, you
                                    must be continually talking to yourself in terms of the way you want to be rather
                                    than the way things are at the moment. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn
                                    neurolinguistic programming, the way that you talk to yourself about what is
                                    happening to you is called your ''interpretive style.'' The way you interpret things
                                    is a key part of changing your thinking. The question is always whether you
                                    interpret things that are happening around you in a positive or negative way.
                                    Remember, the optimist sees the glass as half full while the pessimist sees the
                                    glass as half empty. Choose to be an optimist. <br><br>
                                <li><b>BECOME AN INVERSE PARANOID</b>
                                  <p> <br>The multimillionaire W. Clement Stone started off selling newspapers on the
                                    streets of Chicago at the age of 12. He went on to build Combined Insurance Company
                                    of America, and died recently at the age of 100 worth more than $800 million. He was
                                    a great inspiration to thousands of people, and was famous for his habit of being an
                                    ''inverse paranoid.'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspA paranoid is someone who
                                    believes that people are conspiring against him or her. An inverse paranoid, in
                                    contrast, is a person who is convinced that the world is conspiring to make him or
                                    her successful. An inverse paranoid insists upon interpreting everything that
                                    happens as part of a great plan leading to success. W. Clement Stone used to respond
                                    to every difficulty with the emphatic statement, ''That's good!'' Then he would
                                    concentrate his attention on finding out what was good about the situation. And he
                                    always found something, even if it was just a valuable lesson. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbspIf you change the definition of a problem to a situation, a challenge, or
                                    an opportunity, your response to the problem will be positive and constructive,
                                    rather than negative and angry. If you look at every problem as a potential
                                    opportunity, you will almost always find within the problem an opportunity or
                                    benefit that you can take advantage of. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspNorman
                                    Vincent Peale used to say, ''When God wants to send you a gift, He wraps it up in a
                                    problem.'' The bigger the problem that you have, the bigger the gift - in the form
                                    of valuable lessons,ideas, and insights that it probably contains. Is the glass half
                                    full or is it half empty? It's up to you. <br><br>
                                <li><b>YOU WILL BELIEVE IT WHEN YOU SEE IT</b>
                                  <p> <br>The third part of the five-part process of supercharging your thinking is
                                    visualization.You already know how powerful this can be in helping you to achieve
                                    your goals. It is only when you learn to use visualization on every goal and
                                    activity that you will truly tap into its amazing power for good in your life.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAs it happens, everyone visualizes, all the time. The
                                    difference is that successful people visualize the things they want, and
                                    unsuccessful people visualize the things they don't want. Prior to every new
                                    experience, a successful person will take a few moments to recall and relive a
                                    previous successful experience in that area. Unsuccessful people, in contrast, prior
                                    to a new experience will recall and relive a previous failure experience.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn each case, people are creating a predisposition to
                                    succeed or fail. When they visualize, they send a command to their subconscious
                                    minds. The subconscious mind then coordinates their words and actions in the
                                    upcoming situation so that they perform consistent with that picture. <br><br>
                                <li><b>IMAGINE A PERFECT OUTCOME</b>
                                  <p> <br>In visualizing, you project your mind forward and create a clear picture of
                                    your ideal future goal.You imagine what it would look like if it were already
                                    achieved.You make your picture as vivid as possible. You repeat this mental picture
                                    over and over, as often as you possibly can during the day, and for as long as you
                                    can. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThere is a direct relationship between how
                                    clearly you can see your goal or performance on the inside and how rapidly it comes
                                    into your reality on the outside.Visualization is one of the most powerful faculties
                                    available to you to become a possibility thinker, to change your thinking about your
                                    life and your future.With visualization, you can make your current dreams into
                                    future realities.You can change your thinking completely by changing your mental
                                    pictures. <br><br>
                                <li><b>PROGRAM YOUR MIND</b>
                                  <p> <br>There are three techniques combining verbalization and visualization that you
                                    can practice to achieve your goals faster. These are often referred to as ''mental
                                    programming techniques.'' They are amazingly effective in preparing yourself and
                                    your mind for an upcoming event. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe first of these
                                    methods is what is called the <i>quick programming technique.</i> Here is how it
                                    works. Prior to any nonrecurring event of importance, like a sales call, a meeting,
                                    or an interview, you take a few moments to prepare mentally, like an athlete would
                                    warm up for a competition. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspFirst, take a few deep
                                    breaths. This relaxes you and drops your mind into the alpha state. In this state,
                                    your subconscious mind becomes highly receptive to any incoming command. Second, you
                                    visualize the ideal outcome of the upcoming situation.You imagine it as turning out
                                    perfectly for you in every respect. For example, if you are making a sales call,
                                    visualize the client responding to you in a positive, receptive way. Especially,
                                    visualize the client signing the check or sales order at the end of the
                                    conversation. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOne of my good friends has used this
                                    technique for many years to become one of the highest-paid people in his industry.
                                    He says it is absolutely amazing how many times the sales situation works out
                                    exactly as he visualized it before he went in.Try it for yourself and see.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                <li><b>Affirm and Visualize</b>
                                  <p> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe third and last part of the quick programming
                                    technique is for you to verbalize or create a positive affirmation that is
                                    consistent with your mental picture. A simple affirmation would be ''This sales call
                                    goes extremely well and concludes satisfactorily for everyone involved.'' This
                                    command instructs your subconscious mind to give you the words, feelings, behaviors,
                                    and body language consistent with achieving your goal of a successful sales call.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWe teach this ''quick affirmation'' technique to
                                    applicants who are going on job interviews, speakers giving public talks, performers
                                    in the arts, and even to politicians. It is an extraordinarily effective technique,
                                    and it only takes a few seconds prior to each event. <br><br>
                                <li><b>WRITE AND REVIEW YOUR GOALS</b>
                                  <p> <br>The second method you can use to bring about rapid internal changes to your
                                    thinking and your life is called the <i>standard affirmation technique.</i> This
                                    technique requires that you write out your major goals in the form of present,
                                    positive, personal affirmations on three-by-five index cards, one goal per card.You
                                    can work on 10 to 15 goals at a time using this method. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspCarry these cards around with you. At the beginning of each day, take a few
                                    minutes by yourself to review each goal. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspTake the
                                    first card and read it. Perhaps the first card says, ''I earn $50,000 per year.''
                                    Read the card and let your eyes focus on the message so that it is imprinted on your
                                    subconscious mind. Then, close your eyes, take a deep breath, and repeat the
                                    affirmation five times. As you affirm, visualize your goal as already achieved. See
                                    it. Feel it. Then open your eyes, relax, exhale deeply, and read the next card.

                                  <p> <br>This entire exercise, with 10 to 15 goals, takes about 10 minutes. It programs
                                    your subconscious mind at a deep level, and prepares you to perform at your very
                                    best for the rest of the day. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIf you practice this
                                    each morning before you start out and each evening before you go to bed, you will be
                                    absolutely amazed at how quickly your goals begin to materialize. <br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYour subconscious mind is the sending and receiving station for the
                                    power of attraction in your life. The more you feed your subconscious mind with
                                    words and pictures consistent with what you want to accomplish, the more you
                                    magnetize your goals.You become a <i>living magnet.</i> You begin to attract people,
                                    opportunities, ideas, and resources into your life that make achieving your goals a
                                    possibility. <br><br>
                                <li><b>PRACTICE MENTAL REHEARSAL</b>
                                  <p> <br>The third mental programming technique that you can use to perform better and
                                    achieve your goals faster is often called mental rehearsal. It is taught and used
                                    extensively in sports of all kinds. The process is both simple and powerful.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspFirst, you sit or lie down, completely relaxed, with
                                    your eyes closed, and breath deeply until your whole body is calm and quiet.
                                    <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspSecond, you clearly visualize an upcoming event, or a
                                    goal that you desire. You allow yourself to enter into the experience and see it
                                    clearly in your mind. You imagine yourself actually doing and saying the things you
                                    would if the upcoming situation is perfect. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOne of
                                    the very best times to practice mental rehearsal is just before you go to sleep. By
                                    verbalizing and visualizing your ideal goals or activities for the coming day
                                    immediately prior to sleeping, you program your subconscious mind to work on those
                                    goals all night long. Then, when you wake up in the morning, you will often have
                                    insights and ideas that you can use to make those goals a reality. It is an amazing
                                    technique and is extremely effective. <br><br>
                                <li><b>PREPROGRAM FOR PEAK PERFORMANCE</b>
                                  <p> <br>You can use this technique to preprogram your mind for a variety of things.
                                    For example, let us say you have a problem that you are worried about. Just before
                                    you go to sleep, turn this problem over to your superconscious mind and ask for a
                                    solution. Then, forget about it and go to sleep.Very often, when you wake up in the
                                    morning the solution will occur to you. It will be crystal clear and perfect in
                                    every respect. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYou can use this method of mental
                                    programming to assure that you wake up feeling positive and energetic. The process
                                    is both simple and effective. Just before going to sleep, say to yourself, ''When I
                                    wake up in the morning, I feel terrific!'' Repeat this several times. Imagine
                                    yourself getting up the next morning feeling happy and full of energy. Especially
                                    when you go to bed late and you need to be at your best the next day, use this
                                    technique to wake up feeling refreshed. It works every time. <br><br>
                                <li><b>WAKE AT A CERTAIN TIME</b>
                                  <p> <br>You can use mental rehearsal and preprogramming to wake up at the desired time
                                    without an alarm clock. No matter where you are, or in what time zone, you can ''set
                                    your mind'' on a certain time before you go to sleep, and you will wake up at
                                    exactly that minute. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspBefore you fall asleep, you say,
                                    ''I wake up tomorrow morning at seven o'clock sharp.'' You can then fall to sleep
                                    without worrying. The next morning, your heart rate will gradually speed up, waking
                                    you at your preset time.You will be unable to go back to sleep.You can even travel
                                    great distances and wake up in different time zones on schedule using this method.

                                <li><b>GET THE FEELING OF SUCCESS</b>
                                  <p> <br>The fourth element in mental programming is emotionalization.This requires
                                    that you create the feeling that would go with successful accomplishment of your
                                    goal. This is the part that makes idealizing, verbalizing, and visualizing really
                                    work for you.Your emotions are the energy source, the jet fuel that drives you
                                    toward your goal. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYou have heard it said that humans
                                    are 10 percent logical and 90 percent emotional.The fact is, however, that you are
                                    initially 100 percent emotional.You decide emotionally, and then justify logically.
                                    Everything you do is governed and controlled by your emotions, in some way. The only
                                    question is, ''What emotion is in charge?'' <br><br>
                                <li><b>MASTER OR SLAVE?</b>
                                  <p> <br>Many people are slaves to their emotions. With very little control over their
                                    feelings, they continually react and respond to other people and situations.They
                                    have no minds of their own. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOne of your chief
                                    responsibilities to yourself is to get your emotions under control. Take charge of
                                    your positive emotions rather than allowing yourself to be dominated by your
                                    negative emotions. By using your emotions deliberately and purposefully, especially
                                    by keeping them positive and focused on what you want, you can put enormous power
                                    behind your visualizations, verbalizations, and idealizations. <br><br>
                                <li><b>IMAGINE YOUR IDEAL OUTCOME</b>
                                  <p> <br>One way to unlock the energy and power contained in your emotional nature is
                                    for you to get the feeling that you would enjoy if you had already achieved your
                                    goal. See it in your mind's eye and create within you the emotions you would
                                    experience if your dream came true this very minute. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspImagine, for example, that your goal is to earn a certain amount of money.
                                    Project mentally into the future and see yourself earning this kind of money. See
                                    the larger house, the bigger car, the better clothes, the nicer restaurants, and the
                                    more elegant lifestyle that you will enjoy when you are earning this amount of
                                    money. Imagine how you would feel if you were already enjoying all these ingredients
                                    of success. Imagine the feelings of pride, happiness, satisfaction, pleasure, joy,
                                    and gratitude that you would experience once you achieved this goal. <br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbspJust like a person soaking in a hot bath, soak your mind in these
                                    feelings, exactly as if you were already at your destination. These emotions will
                                    then trigger thoughts, desires, and actions consistent with them. Each will
                                    reinforce the other. <br><br>
                                <li><b>THE COMBINATION IS POWERFUL</b>
                                  <p> <br>When you combine all three - a mental picture, a verbalization, and an emotion
                                    - you activate your subconscious mind. Your subconscious mind then passes this
                                    impression on to your <i>superconscious</i> mind, which works on your goals 24 hours
                                    per day. When you practice combining verbalization, visualization, and
                                    emotionalization on every goal, you will be absolutely astonished at the things that
                                    begin happening to you, and the goals that you accomplish. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspOnce you activate your superconscious mind, you will receive a continuous
                                    stream of insights and ideas that you can use to solve your problems and achieve
                                    your goals.This mind will show you how to remove, get around, or climb over any
                                    obstacle that appears on your path. It will bring you the information that you need,
                                    at exactly the right time for you. It will give you intuitions and hunches that
                                    guide you to make the right decisions. Your superconscious mind will give you a
                                    steady flow of energy, enthusiasm, and motivation that will drive you toward your
                                    goals. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe way you activate this process and unleash
                                    all your mental powers is by continually idealizing, verbalizing, visualizing, and
                                    especially emotionalizing. <br><br>
                                <li><b>DREAMS COME TRUE</b>
                                  <p> <br>The fifth element in this five-step power process is realization, to actually
                                    achieve your goals and to have your wishes come true. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspThis is the most important part of the process. But you must be aware that
                                    every goal takes a certain amount of time to materialize. Some goals can be achieved
                                    quickly. Some require weeks and even months of patient, steady work. Others are
                                    long-term goals, requiring several years to bring to fruition.Your attitude toward
                                    the time required for goal attainment has a major impact on whether and when you
                                    accomplish them. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn the realization phase, after you
                                    have practiced the first four steps, you simply relax and let go of the process.You
                                    allow your goal to appear in its own time. Exactly the things that you want and need
                                    will come to you at exactly the time that you are ready for them. <br><br>&nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbspSuccessful people eventually develop an attitude of calm, confident
                                    expectation. They are never rushed or hurried. They are relaxed and confident, and
                                    they absolutely believe that everything is conspiring to bring them exactly what
                                    they want, at exactly the right time for them. This must be your attitude as well.

                                  <p> <br>You can get even greater benefit from this five-step process for achieving
                                    your goals by using special techniques in response to the things that happen to you
                                    each day. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspFirst of all, no matter what happens,
                                    <i>look for the good</i> in every situation. Seek the valuable lesson. Look for what
                                    you can gain from any temporary setback or obstacle. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspNapoleon Hill studied and interviewed successful men and women for 25 years. He
                                    found that they had one characteristic in common. Each of them had developed the
                                    habit of continually looking into every difficulty for the seed of an equal or
                                    greater benefit or advantage.They constantly looked for the silver lining of even
                                    their darkest cloud. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen you are looking for
                                    something good to come out of every problem situation, you will respond to
                                    difficulties in a more positive, creative, and constructive way.You will be more
                                    optimistic and confident. If you think that you are going to benefit from everything
                                    that happens to you, you will develop the attitude of the possibility thinker. As a
                                    result, no matter what happens, you will almost always find something good that you
                                    can turn to your benefit or advantage. <br><br>

                                    Your mind is most receptive to new ideas first thing in the morning.You can
                                    accelerate the process of changing your thinking by starting off every morning by
                                    reading for 30 to 60 minutes in something uplifting and inspirational before you
                                    start your day. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspJust as vigorous physical exercise in

                                    &nbspThe first hour of the morning is called the ''rudder of the day.'' Whatever you
                                    put into your mind in this ''golden hour'' sets the tone of your thinking for the
                                    rest of the day.When you get up in the morning and, instead of reading the newspaper
                                    or watching television, you read something positive, constructive, and inspiring,
                                    you preprogram your mind for the hours ahead. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp

                                    to become drowsy again. All the blood in your brain will rush to your stomach to try

                                    then compensate by drinking coffee all morning to wake up. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbspBut when you start each day with a light, healthy, nutritious breakfast, you

                                    get on with the day.You will be more creative because more of your blood is
                                    available to your brain. You will be brighter and sharper.You will see more
                                    possibilities in everything that is going on around you. You will be a more

                                        obstacles, and even outright defeats, in the course of his or her life. But it
                                        has been the ability to respond positively and constructively to these defeats
                                        and to bounce back that ultimately has assured success. This quality of bouncing
                                        rather than breaking will determine your success as well. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                        &nbsp &nbspDr. Abraham Zaleznik of the Harvard Business School did a study some
                                        years ago on the role that <i>disappointment</i> plays in life. Many people had
                                        researched and written on motivation and its relationship to success. But
                                        Zaleznik was the first person who looked at the other side of the coin. <br><br>
                                    <li><b>THINKING AHEAD</b>
                                      <p> <br>If you are a normal, intelligent person, you will organize each area of
                                        your life to avoid failure and disappointment as much as possible. You will
                                        think ahead and anticipate what could go wrong. You will then take the necessary
                                        precautions to guard against setbacks and problems.You will weigh and balance
                                        different options. You will select the course of action that offers the greatest
                                        likelihood of success. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspNonetheless, no matter how
                                        well you think and plan, things will not always turn out the way you expect.
                                        Murphy's Law says: <i>''Whatever can go wrong will go wrong. Of all the things
                                          that can go wrong, the worst possible thing will go wrong at the worst
                                          possible time and cost the most amount of money.''</i> Cohen's Law then adds:
                                        <i>''Murphy was an optimist!''</i> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspTherefore,
                                        disappointment comes unbidden. Disappointment comes in spite of your best
                                        efforts to avoid it. Disappointment is inevitable and unavoidable. As sure as
                                        the sun rises in the east and sets in the west, you are going to experience
                                        disappointments in life. And the more goals you set and the more things you try,
                                        the more difficulties and problems you will have. <br><br>
                                    <li><b>THE ONE THING YOU CAN CONTROL</b>
                                      <p> <br>What Dr. Zaleznik discovered was that successful people respond to
                                        disappointment differently from unsuccessful people. His conclusion was that the
                                        way you deal with disappointment is an extremely good predictor of whether you
                                        will achieve success in your field, or in life overall. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                        &nbsp &nbspSince you can't always avoid disappointment, no matter what you do,
                                        the only thing that matters is how you deal with the disappointment when it
                                        comes upon you, unwanted and unexpected. Do you let it overwhelm you? Do you
                                        blow up, become angry, and blame or attack other people? Or do you roll with the
                                        punches, and respond effectively? <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspSuccessful
                                        people deal with disappointment by taking it in stride. Unsuccessful people
                                        allow disappointment to stop them. Successful people recover and continue
                                        forward. Unsuccessful people often quit and go back. Motivational speaker
                                        Charlie Jones says, <i>''It's not how far you fall but how high you bounce that
                                          counts!''</i> <br><br>
                                    <li><b>THE TRIGGER OF NEGATIVITY</b>
                                      <p> <br>Most negative emotions are triggered by frustrated expectations.You wish,
                                        hope, or plan for something to happen in a certain way, and when it doesn't, you
                                        react with impatience and anger. This is quite normal. If you care about a
                                        result, you are going to be hurt if you don't achieve it. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                        &nbsp &nbspThe challenge is that emotions are triggered instantaneously. For
                                        this reason, you can have very little control over your emotions and reactions
                                        at the moment that something happens to you. It is too late. When the
                                        disappointment occurs, you will react instinctively and habitually, depending on
                                        your previous experiences. When things go wrong, it is too late for you to think
                                        of fine and noble thoughts.You simply react. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                        &nbspEpictetus, the Greek Stoic philosopher, once wrote, ''Circumstances do not
                                        make the man; they only reveal him to himself,'' and to others, for that matter.
                                        It is not the adverse situation that builds your character so much as it
                                        <i>reveals</i> your character as it exists at that moment. <br><br>
                                    <li><b>PREPARE IN ADVANCE</b>
                                      <p> <br>One of the best ways to change your thinking, and your life, is to prepare
                                        for disappointment in advance. Set yourself up to bounce back quickly by
                                        practicing mental prepreparation. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspMental
                                        prepreparation enables you to prepare internally for the inevitable
                                        disappointments of life and work, even though you do not know what they are or
                                        when they will come. This is one of the most powerful of all thinking techniques
                                        that you can use to gain and keep control of your emotions, assuring that they
                                        are primarily positive and constructive, no matter what happens. <br><br>&nbsp
                                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn mental prepreparation, you begin with the premise that you
                                        are going to face all kinds of problems and difficulties when you decide to
                                        accomplish anything worthwhile in life. In fact, if you set a big, challenging
                                        goal for yourself, one that forces you out of your comfort zone, you are going
                                        to meet with countless obstacles and difficulties that you cannot now imagine.
                                        <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThis trial by endurance seems to go with the
                                        territory. Every time you try to be or do something more or different, problems
                                        of all kinds will arise in your path. If you are not prepared in advance, they
                                        can discourage you and drive you back into your comfort zone. <br><br>&nbsp
                                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbspInstead of waiting for the inevitable problems to occur, you
                                        mentally prepare for these inevitable difficulties before they happen. You say
                                        to yourself: <i>''Today I will face all kinds of ups and downs, difficulties and
                                          setbacks, but I will not let them get me down. Once I start toward my goal, I
                                          will be unstoppable!''</i> <br><br>
                                    <li><b>PRACTICE CRISIS ANTICIPATION</b>
                                      <p> <br>In business consulting, we teach a way of thinking called ''crisis
                                        anticipation.'' I encourage decision makers to look six months to a year into
                                        the future and ask the question, ''What are some of the negative things that
                                        could happen that would derail our plans? Of all of them, what are the very
                                        worst things that could happen?'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWe then make a
                                        list of all the different setbacks or unexpected emergencies that could occur
                                        that would threaten the enterprise. For example: A competitor could come out
                                        with a new product or service that was better and/or cheaper than ours. Interest
                                        rates could go up. Government could place new taxes and regulations on our
                                        activities. Costs of fuel or raw materials could increase. A key person or
                                        persons within the organization could depart for some reason. A key customer or
                                        customers could leave and go to a competitor. Competitors could cut their prices
                                        below costs in order to take business away. The economy could tip into recession
                                        and the overall market could shrink dramatically. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                        &nbspIn each of these cases, the ability of the company to respond quickly and
                                        effectively could determine its very survival. These possible reversals and
                                        setbacks should be thought through in advance. The best rule is ''no
                                        surprises!'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspRoyal Dutch/Shell of the Netherlands
                                        has one of the most complete forward planning processes of any company in the

                                        occur around the world in areas where it has oil and gas operations. As a
                                        result, the company is seldom surprised by anything that happens. It is never
                                        caught off guard. It always has a backup plan ready to go. It has also become
                                        one of the most continuously profitable and successful companies in the world.

                                        particular area. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspFor example, what would you do
                                        if you lost your job today? The idea of losing one's job is a major fear for
                                        most people, affecting 37 percent of the working population according to one
                                        study. I received a letter recently from a gentleman who told me that his fear
                                        of losing his job, which he recognized was completely irrational, was so great
                                        that it was paralyzing him. It was actually holding him back from doing the kind
                                        of work that he had to do in order to keep his job. His fear and his lack of
                                        alternatives were actually increasing the likelihood that he would be laid off.

                                    <li><b>YOUR NEW JOB</b>
                                      <p> <br>Sometimes I ask people in my audiences, <i>''What is your next job going
                                          to be?''</i> For most people this question comes as a surprise. They have not
                                        even thought about what their next job is going to be. But we know that the
                                        world of work is changing at a rapid rate. The fact is that you have already
                                        changed jobs several times. It is virtually inevitable that you will change jobs
                                        again, and perhaps sooner than you expect.What is your next job likely to be?
                                        <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen I explain that each person must be preparing
                                        for his or her next job, it is a new idea for most people. They either have not
                                        thought about it or don't want to think about it. But the only question is this:
                                        ''What level of knowledge, skills, and ability will you require at your next job
                                        in order to continue to earn the kind of money that you want to earn in the
                                        future?'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIf you don't think about this question
                                        in advance, you may be forced to think about it when your time has run out and
                                        the question is forced upon you. <br><br>
                                    <li><b>YOUR NEW CAREER</b>
                                      <p> <br>After audience members have thought about what their next job is going to
                                        be, I then ask the second question, <i>''What is your next career going to
                                          be?''</i> What entirely new field, industry, business, or line of work are you
                                        going to be in 5 to 10 years from now? <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAccording
                                        to employment experts, a person starting work today will have an average of 14
                                        or 15 full-time jobs, each lasting two years or more, over the course of a
                                        working lifetime. He or she will also have as many as five different careers, in
                                        completely different fields, each of which will require new kinds of knowledge
                                        and different skills. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspMuch of what you know about
                                        your current work will be obsolete within five years. Because of rapid changes
                                        taking place in every area, your existing store of knowledge, information,
                                        ideas, and skills will be of little value. These will have no relevance or
                                        application to the job market and the economy of the future.You will need new
                                        knowledge and skills if you want to survive and thrive in an increasingly
                                        competitive society. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThis is why Peter Drucker
                                        said, ''The only skill that will not become obsolete in the years ahead is the
                                        ability to learn new skills.'' <br><br>
                                    <li><b>CONTINUALLY THINK AHEAD</b>
                                      <p> <br>You probably recall the famous comment by hockey star Wayne Gretzky. When
                                        he was asked by a reporter for the secret of his success on the ice, he replied
                                        by saying, <i>''Most players are pretty good, but they go to where the puck is.
                                          I go to where the puck is going to be.''</i> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                        &nbspThis observation is directly relevant to you. Where is your puck going to
                                        be three to five years from now? Where is your puck going to be 10 years from
                                        now? Taking a long-term perspective on your work life enables you to make better
                                        decisions in the short term. As strategic planner Michael Kami says, <i>''Those
                                          who do not think about the future cannot have one.''</i> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                        &nbsp &nbspLook into your future and begin to imagine and anticipate some of the
                                        twists and turns that might occur. If you lost your job today, how would you
                                        react? What would be your first thought? The great majority of people, when they
                                        think about losing their jobs, go into a form of panic.They have no idea what
                                        they would do. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspHowever, in my work with many
                                        thousands of successful people, I have found that they have one particular
                                        attitude in common. They all know with complete assurance that if they lost
                                        their jobs they could walk across the street and get another job tomorrow. They
                                        are so good at what they do, and so confident in their abilities, that job loss
                                        to them would be merely an inconvenience. They have lots of options.
                                        <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAs I mentioned in Chapter 6, there is a way to
                                        determine how good you are in your field.What is the number of job offers you
                                        get on a regular basis? Just as a store or restaurant can measure its success by
                                        the number of customers or patrons it attracts, you can measure how valued and
                                        respected you are for what you do by counting the number of people who want to
                                        hire you and use your services. How are you doing? <br><br>
                                    <li><b>EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED</b>
                                      <p> <br>Sometimes I ask audiences what they would do if their entire industry
                                        disappeared overnight. They shake their heads and they say that can't possibly
                                        happen. Then I point out that the defense industry in California literally
                                        collapsed in the early 1990s and over 400,000 highly competent defense engineers
                                        and executives, with many years of education and experience, were rendered
                                        obsolete. Their jobs were not only gone; they were gone forever. Each of these
                                        thousands of competent, capable men and women were forced into the position of
                                        going out into the marketplace, developing new skills, and going to work in
                                        entirely new fields. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe collapse of the dot-com
                                        mania wiped out more than 90 percent of the Internet jobs and companies that had
                                        sprung up across the country. The collapse in the telecom sector led to layoffs
                                        of many thousands of workers. The decline in recent years of the frantic
                                        investment activity that had been seen during the 1990s triggered the layoffs
                                        and firings of tens of thousands of people in the financial services industries.
                                        It goes on and on, and will continue. Only the names of the industries will
                                        change.This rapid shift in jobs and industries is going to happen more and more
                                        often to more and more people. <br><br>
                                    <li><b>YOUR FINANCIAL LIFE</b>
                                      <p> <br>The world of finance and investments is constantly changing. The markets
                                        are increasingly volatile. The old philosophy of ''buy and hold'' is no longer
                                        relevant to the world of today, and tomorrow. If you have money invested, you
                                        should be thinking continually about what might happen if your investments went
                                        bad and you lost all your money.You should always be preparing against the worst
                                        possible outcome of a particular investment. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                        &nbspThere is a direct relationship between how much time you invest in thinking
                                        about and planning your financial life and how likely you are to become
                                        financially independent. According to Dr. Thomas Stanley's interviews with
                                        thousands of self-made millionaires, they share a common characteristic: they
                                        spend far more time thinking about financial matters than the average person.
                                        <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe average adult, even though he or she worries
                                        about money much of the time, spends only two to three hours per month actually
                                        thinking about his or her finances, usually at bill-paying time. The average
                                        affluent American, in contrast, spends 20 to 30 hours per month thinking about
                                        his or her money. As a result, they make far better spending decisions and more
                                        intelligent investments than the majority. They become increasingly skilled in
                                        money matters, and eventually pull ahead of their peers. <br><br>
                                    <li><b>THE STRATEGY OF NAPOLEON</b>
                                      <p> <br>The French general Napoleon dominated the continent of Europe for almost
                                        20 years. He led his armies to victory in dozens of battles, and lost only three
                                        battles in his entire career. He lost almost 600,000 men when he invaded Russia,
                                        failing to anticipate the cold of the Russian winter. Greatly weakened from the
                                        Russian campaign, he subsequently lost the battle of Leipzig, which led to his
                                        being exiled to the island of Elba. And finally, he lost at the battle of
                                        Waterloo due to a series of miscommunications with his field generals.
                                        <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIt is often forgotten that he won many other
                                        battles, small and large, and is considered to be one of the three greatest
                                        military geniuses of history. (Alexander the Great and Genghis Khan were the
                                        other two.) Napoleon had developed a quality that helped him to achieve victory,
                                        which you also can develop. It is called <i>extrapolatory thinking.</i> This is
                                        the ability to think and plan several moves ahead in whatever you are doing.
                                        This way of thinking involves your considering every possible event that could
                                        occur, and then making provisions for them, well in advance. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                        &nbsp &nbspNapoleon personally felt that his thoroughness and depth of
                                        preparation, carefully considering every detail, were his key to victory. This
                                        quality was demonstrated by his phenomenal ability to arrive onto the field of a
                                        potential battle and then to think through every single possible twist and turn
                                        of the battle to its logical conclusion - before the first shot was fired.
                                        <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOnce he had completed his preparations, he could
                                        take his position at his command center to direct the battle. No matter what
                                        news he received from any part of the battlefield, he was always ready with an
                                        immediate response. Many people thought that his quickness of response under
                                        fire was because he was a brilliant thinker, which he was, but that was not the
                                        secret of his success. His secret was that he had thought through every possible
                                        eventuality, in advance. <br><br>
                                    <li><b>EXTRAPOLATE FROM THE PRESENT</b>
                                      <p> <br>This ability, to think through every major situation in your life in
                                        advance, is a way of thinking that you can learn with practice.The better you
                                        become at anticipating future events based on current facts, the better your

                                        Thinking this way will give you an edge over others who simply react and respond

                                        the next six months to a year that could affect your job and your security. If
                                        you own the company, you should identify the worst possible things that could
                                        affect the survival and health of your enterprise. You and your spouse should
                                        discuss possible problems and difficulties that might occur in your family life,
                                        and then make plans to guard against them. <br><br>
                                    <li><b>TAKE NECESSARY FINANCIAL PRECAUTIONS</b>
                                      <p> <br>You often read about people who failed to insure properly and consequently
                                        lost their cars, their homes, and sometimes all of their possessions. They
                                        failed to look into the future and ask what the consequences to their life would
                                        be if a fire occurred in their home or if they had a traffic accident and they
                                        were not sufficiently insured. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOne of the
                                        smartest things that you can do to preserve your financial well-being is to
                                        develop a regular savings program.Your goal should be to save 10 percent and
                                        more of your income, off the top, each month, from each paycheck or income
                                        source. There are few things that will give a greater sense of confidence and
                                        control than for you to know that you have a cash reserve set aside in the event
                                        of an unexpected emergency. In contrast, there is nothing that will cause you
                                        more stress and tension than to be living on the edge of your financial
                                        resources, unable to deal with a financial emergency or a need of any kind.
                                        <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspW. Clement Stone once said, <i>''If you cannot
                                          save money, then the seeds of greatness are not in you.''</i> <br><br>
                                    <li><b>LIVE WITHIN YOUR INCOME</b>
                                      <p> <br>Your ability to save money and to discipline yourself to live within your
                                        income is a key measure of your ability to succeed in life. If you do not have
                                        the internal self-control to refrain from spending everything you earn, this
                                        suggests that you probably don't have the discipline necessary to succeed in
                                        other areas of your life. Although the Bible says that the love of money is the
                                        root of all evil, it is far more likely that the lack of money is the root of
                                        all evil. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspPerhaps the greatest benefit of saving
                                        your money and building up a cash reserve is that it enables you to take
                                        advantage of opportunities when they arise, as they always do. In the movie
                                        Field of Dreams, a profound idea was expressed: ''If you build it, they will
                                        come.'' In the financial world, this means that if you accumulate money through
                                        hard work and saving, you will attract into your life opportunities to invest
                                        that money to earn even more. <br><br>
                                    <li><b>LIVE WITHIN YOUR INCOME</b>
                                      <p> <br>The Law of Attraction is very powerful in monetary matters.When you save
                                        even a small amount of money and put it in a bank account or a carefully chosen
                                        mutual fund, you create a certain force field of energy around that money. This
                                        energy somehow begins to attract even more money into your life. As your savings
                                        and investments grow, the magnetic power of your money grows even stronger. The
                                        more money you accumulate, the more money that will be attracted to you, and the
                                        more opportunities you will have to accumulate even more. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                        &nbsp &nbspWhen you think about your money and the pleasure it gives you to have
                                        money in the bank, you increase the energy field around your money and you
                                        attract even more. This force field becomes even more powerful when you love
                                        your money. When you think about your growing financial reserves with intense
                                        happiness, you intensify the energy around your money and you attract even more.
                                        <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen people say that it takes money to make
                                        money, they are right in two special ways. First, your ability to save money and
                                        build up a nest egg is a measure of whether you have the ability to earn even
                                        more money and whether you can be trusted with money. Second, when you put
                                        together even a small amount of money, you will attract opportunities to
                                        accumulate an even larger amount. <br><br>
                                    <li><b>A SUCCESS STORY</b>
                                      <p> <br>A participant came up to me at a seminar recently and asked if I
                                        remembered him. I told him that unfortunately I spoke to too many people each
                                        year to remember all of them. He reminded me that he had attended my two-day
                                        seminar about six years before. He was quite shy so he waited at the lunch break
                                        until everyone had left. He then told me about a most remarkable series of
                                        events that had happened to him since the seminar. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                        &nbspWhen he came to my seminar, he was a used car salesman. He had two children
                                        and was in his early thirties. He was earning an average income and was up to
                                        his neck in debt. He was living in a rented house with his family. <br><br>&nbsp
                                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAt the seminar, he decided that his biggest source of worry was
                                        the fact that he was in debt and had no money in the bank. So he set a goal to
                                        get out of debt and to save $30,000 over the next five years. This was a huge
                                        goal for him, considering his circumstances and his past. He had not been out of
                                        debt since his teens. <br><br>
                                    <li><b>TAKING ACTION</b>
                                      <p> <br>Nonetheless, in faith, he wrote down his goal, made a plan, and began
                                        working on it every day.This decision activated his mental powers. Because of
                                        the Law of Correspondence, the Law of Attraction, and the Law of Subconscious
                                        Activity, among others, things began to change for him far faster than he had
                                        imagined. He actually achieved his financial goal in only three years. He was
                                        out of debt and had $30,000 in the bank. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOne day,
                                        his boss, the owner of the dealership, called him in and asked him if he was
                                        interested in a business opportunity. He was quite flattered and asked his boss
                                        to explain. His boss said that he had observed how much better he had become as
                                        a salesman, and he had also heard that he had saved up some money from his
                                        income. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThis salesman was shy and cautious, and
                                        asked his boss what he had in mind. His boss told him that he had been
                                        approached by the automobile manufacturer in Detroit and asked to recommend
                                        someone who would be interested in opening a new car dealership in the same city
                                        in a growing part of town. The boss said he was willing to recommend him, and
                                        back him in this dealership. He would go in with him as a full partner if he
                                        were willing to put in his money as well. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe
                                        final outcome of this story was that his boss helped him set up the new
                                        dealership; he helped him with all the purchasing, inventory, parts, service
                                        department decisions, and staffing. After two years, his boss sold the half
                                        share back to him, so he ended up owning the dealership 100 percent.
                                        <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThen he said to me, ''And today, I'm a
                                        millionaire.'' He said, ''Six years ago I was a used car salesman, and today I
                                        am a millionaire.'' He was one of the happiest people I've ever met. He said if
                                        he had not taken that advice from the seminar and begun saving his money and
                                        getting out of debt, he would not have been in a position to take advantage of
                                        that opportunity when it came along. He said, ''Taking your seminar probably
                                        saved me 20 years of hard work, and maybe even a lifetime.'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                        &nbsp &nbspThis story applies to your life as well. One of the most important
                                        actions that you can take to remain positive and optimistic is to prepare
                                        mentally, financially, and physically in advance. Think through what might
                                        possibly happen and make plans to prepare for opportunities. Make plans and put
                                        aside reserves to minimize or escape the consequences of a financial setback.
                                        This way of thinking, of planning ahead in every area, is a mark of the superior
                                        individual. <br><br>
                                    <li><b>TWO MAGIC QUESTIONS</b>
                                      <p> <br>Here are two questions that you can ask to turn failure into success. I
                                        call these the magic questions because of the incredible power they have to
                                        improve your life.You can ask them and benefit from them after every experience.
                                        <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe first question is, <i>''What did I do
                                          right?''</i> No matter what you do, or how it turns out, whether it is a
                                        success or a failure, you should do an instant mental replay of the event and
                                        assess everything that you did right in that situation. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                        &nbsp &nbspEven if it turns out badly, or was a complete failure, there were
                                        always things that you did that were <i>correct.</i> If you can isolate the
                                        positive parts of your performance and write them down, you will be
                                        preprogramming your mind to repeat the things that you did right in the next
                                        similar situation. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe second magic question is,
                                        <i>''What would I do differently?''</i> This is an excellent question because it
                                        forces you to think positively about what happened and how you could do better.
                                        Ask yourself, if you had to do it over again, how would you <i>change or
                                          improve</i> your performance or behavior in that situation? What would you do
                                        more of or less of? <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspBe sure to write down your
                                        answers. This ensures that you capture them before you forget. Each time you try
                                        something new or different, immediately sit down with a pad of paper and answer
                                        those two questions: ''What did I do right?'' and ''What would I do
                                        differently?'' Both of these questions are positive and they both require
                                        positive responses.Your answers prepare you, consciously and unconsciously, to
                                        do even better next time. Both sets of answers keep you focused on improvement
                                        rather than regret. <br><br>
                                    <li><b>POSITIVE VERSUS NEGATIVE THINKING</b>
                                      <p> <br>Both winners and losers examine how they performed after an important
                                        event. But underachievers almost invariably rehash the mistakes they have made,
                                        the expenses they have incurred, and the failures they have experienced. High
                                        achievers, in contrast, those who think positively about themselves and their
                                        lives, are constantly reviewing the best parts of their performance and making
                                        plans to repeat those actions the next time. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen
                                        you think about what you did right and what you could do differently next time,
                                        your mind will be completely positive.Your creativity will be stimulated.You
                                        will see all kinds of opportunities and possibilities for improvement that you
                                        would have missed completely if you allowed yourself to feel sorry for yourself
                                        after an unsuccessful event. <br><br>
                                    <li><b>BUSINESS AND SALES</b>
                                      <p> <br>If you are in business, you should ask these questions regularly of
                                        yourself and your key staff: <i>''What did we do right?''</i> and <i>''What
                                          would we do differently next time?''</i> Remember, most things you try will be
                                        unsuccessful the first few times. By asking these questions, you extract the
                                        greatest value possible from the situation. Treat every experience as an
                                        opportunity to learn something that can help you next time. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                        &nbsp &nbspIf you are in sales, use this method after every sale. Immediately
                                        after a sales call, successful or not, ask the magic questions. This quick
                                        review will dramatically increase the speed at which you learn and grow as a
                                        sales professional. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspMake this instant replay a
                                        part of your life. Use this method repeatedly so that it becomes automatic. No
                                        matter how disappointing the setback or difficulty may be, you will soon be
                                        preprogrammed to learn the most from the situation and to extract every kernel
                                        of good that you can possibly get from it. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen
                                        you combine this method with mindstorming - forcing yourself to generate 20
                                        answers to each question - you will be absolutely astonished at the number of
                                        great ideas and insights for growth and improvement you will come up with. These
                                        ideas will dramatically increase the speed at which you become one of the best
                                        in your field. <br><br>
                                    <li><b>THE EDISON APPROACH</b>
                                      <p> <br>Thomas Edison, the greatest inventor of the modern age, was convinced that
                                        experimentation was simply a <i>process of elimination</i>. He therefore kept
                                        accurate records of every experiment. Once he had decided that an invention was
                                        possible, he dedicated himself to eliminating the ways that wouldn't work until
                                        the only method left standing was the <i>one way</i> that would work. As a
                                        result, he became the greatest inventor of the modern age and one of the
                                        wealthiest businessmen in the country.You should do the same. <br><br>&nbsp
                                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbspFrom now on, each time you try and fail, shrug it off as a
                                        <i>learning experience</i> that just moved you one step closer to success. As
                                        Henry Ford once said, <i>''Failure is merely an opportunity to more
                                          intelligently begin again.''</i> <br><br>
                                    <li><b>YOUR RECOVERY RATE</b>
                                      <p> <br>When you experience a disappointment of any kind, your natural reaction is
                                        to feel stunned emotionally.You feel as though you have been punched in your
                                        emotional solar plexus. You feel hurt, let down, disappointed, and discouraged.
                                        You occasionally feel like quitting altogether and doing something completely
                                        different. These feelings are normal and natural when you experience frustration
                                        or failure of any kind. The only question is, how long do they last?
                                        <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen you go to a doctor or clinic for a complete
                                        medical exam, you will often be given a stress test. First, they will take your
                                        pulse at your resting heart rate.Then they will ask you to do some aerobic
                                        exercises to raise your heart rate. Once your heart rate is up to a particular
                                        point, they will measure it again. They will wait one, two, and five minutes
                                        after the exercise, and again take your pulse. The mark of how fit you are is
                                        how rapidly your heart returns to its resting pulse rate after exercise.

                                    <li><b>BOUNCING BACK</b>
                                      <p> <br>With your personality, it is the same. The mark of how mentally healthy
                                        you are can be measured by how quickly you recover after experiencing a
                                        disappointment. Of course, a setback or reversal will hurt. It always hurts if
                                        what you are trying to do is important to you. But that's not the main point.
                                        The main point is how quickly you bounce back.Your recovery rate is everything.
                                        If you plan in advance for setbacks and problems, and preprogram your mind the
                                        way we have described in this chapter, your recovery rate will be much faster.
                                        <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYour recovery rate is under your control. It is
                                        completely determined by the way you think about what happens to you. It is not
                                        the event itself that affects you, but rather the way that you interpret the
                                        event to yourself. And this is very much a choice you make. <br><br>
                                    <li><b>YOUR INNER DIALOGUE</b>
                                      <p> <br>Here are several powerful affirmations that you can use to take immediate
                                        mental and emotional control over a negative situation. These words quickly
                                        neutralize any negative feelings you might have. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                        &nbspThe first thing you say when something goes wrong is the words: ''I am
                                        responsible!'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYour natural tendency when
                                        something goes wrong will be to become angry and upset and either blame someone
                                        or something else or make excuses. But the moment you say, ''I am responsible!''
                                        you stop blaming someone else for the problem. By accepting responsibility, even
                                        if it is only for the way you react, you short-circuit your feelings of
                                        disappointment, anger, and frustration. The instant you say, ''I am
                                        responsible!'' your mind becomes calm and clear again.You begin to think of
                                        positive, constructive things you can do to minimize the damage or to maximize
                                        the opportunity. <br><br>
                                    <li><b>INTERPRET IT POSITIVELY</b>
                                      <p> <br>Here is an affirmation that has been extraordinarily helpful to me over
                                        the years. No matter what has happened, and no matter how disappointed I am, I
                                        immediately say, <i>''Every experience is a positive experience if I view it as
                                          an opportunity for growth and self-mastery.''</i> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                        &nbspThis statement enables you to assert control over your emotions. It forces
                                        you to think about how you can learn and grow from this problem. Like the
                                        statement ''I am responsible,'' these words give you a sense of control and
                                        personal power in any situation. <i>''Every situation is a positive situation if
                                          I view it as an opportunity for growth and self-mastery.''</i> <br><br>&nbsp
                                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYou then look into the situation and ask yourself what you can
                                        possibly learn from what has just happened. How can you grow as a result of this
                                        difficulty? What has this situation been sent to teach you? If you had a divine
                                        force that was controlling your destiny, and this force was sending you specific
                                        learning experiences to help you to be successful, what lessons could you find
                                        in your current problem? <br><br>
                                    <li><b>ONE THOUGHT AT A TIME</b>
                                      <p> <br>Your mind can hold only one thought at a time, positive or negative. If
                                        you are constructively looking for a solution for or a valuable lesson from
                                        every difficulty, you can't be upset or angry at the same time. If you apply the
                                        Law of Substitution and deliberately force yourself to think about the positive
                                        aspects of the situation, you will always find them.You will then be able to
                                        turn them to your advantage. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspA positive mental
                                        attitude, which means a positive and constructive response to disappointments
                                        and setbacks, is largely determined by your feeling a <i>sense of control.</i>
                                        Having a sense of control means that you feel you are in control of your own
                                        life.You feel that you are in charge.You feel that you are in the driver's
                                        seat.You feel that you are on top of things. <br><br>
                                    <li><b>THINK ABOUT YOUR GOALS</b>
                                      <p> <br>One of the most powerful ways to bounce back from failure is to put the
                                        negative situation into its proper perspective. Remember, failure is never
                                        final. Most mistakes that you make are small relative to the great scheme of
                                        things. If you think back, you will probably not even be able to remember what
                                        it was you were worrying about a year ago, much less three, four, or five years
                                        ago. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe key to your having a sense of control is
                                        for you to develop and maintain a clear sense of direction.This sense of
                                        direction comes from having clear, specific, written goals. One of the most
                                        powerful ways to keep your mind positive is to simply <i>think about your
                                          goals.</i> When something goes wrong, think about your goals.When you lose a
                                        sale, or even a job, think about your goals.When an investment fails or a
                                        business deal falls through, think about your goals. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                        &nbspYour long-term goals are to be financially independent, to enjoy excellent
                                        health, to have wonderful relationships, and to do work that makes a difference
                                        in the world, among others. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen you keep your
                                        mind on these goals, and on what you are doing to achieve each of these goals,
                                        you will find that it is almost impossible to feel upset or angry. Thinking
                                        about your goals empowers you and makes you a more positive and confident
                                        person. <br><br>
                                    <li><b>THINK IN TERMS OF CYCLES AND TRENDS</b>
                                      <p> <br>Look at your life as a series of cycles and trends. Think in terms of
                                        regular ups and downs. Think in terms of summers and winters, falls and springs.
                                        When you develop this long-term perspective and you see things that happen as
                                        part of a larger pattern, you will not be too caught up in short-term
                                        fluctuations of your fortunes. You become much more capable of responding
                                        effectively to little problems and difficulties of day-to-day life. You can put
                                        things into proper perspective. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe sigmoid
                                        curve, which looks like an ''S'' lying on its side, explains much of human life.
                                        It has three phases. In the first phase, you are struggling and working hard to
                                        figure things out and get established. This is true for a job, a relationship, a
                                        new business startup, or the introduction of a new product or service.
                                        <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe second phase comes after you have learned the
                                        critical lessons of phase one. This is the growth phase, where you make great
                                        progress and get excellent results.Your business expands, your products and
                                        services sell well, your career takes off, and your relationships are at their
                                        best. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThen comes phase three, the decline phase,
                                        which follows phase two just as the winter follows the harvest season. In this

                                      <p> <br>Many of our problems in dealing with setbacks and disappointments come
                                        from our resisting reality.We engage in denial.We become angry and insist that
                                        this should not have happened to us or should not have happened at all.We reject
                                        it and wish that it hadn't occurred in the first place. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                        &nbsp &nbspIt is this resistance and denial that causes most of our stress. When
                                        you say, <i>''What can't be cured must be endured,''</i> you lower your flash
                                        point.You become more relaxed.You become calmer and you develop a more detached
                                        perspective.You stand back and you look at the situation as though it were
                                        happening to someone else. As a result you become more constructive about how
                                        the situation can best be resolved.You don't allow yourself to become
                                        emotionally involved in every little thing that happens to you. <br><br>&nbsp
                                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAbraham Lincoln wrote, <i>''Most people are just about as happy
                                          as they make up their minds to be.''</i> In the Foundation for Inner Peace's
                                        Course in Miracles, it says, <i>''You give meaning to everything you see.''</i>
                                        Without the meaning or emotion that you attach to an event or circumstance, it
                                        has no emotional significance for you. And you can change the meaning by
                                        controlling your thinking. You can even eliminate its negative effect on you
                                        altogether by refusing to become emotionally involved in a short-term setback.
                                        It is up to you. <br><br>

                                          <p> <br>Aristotle, perhaps the greatest of the philosophers, wrote more than
                                            2,300 years ago that the ultimate aim of all human action is happiness. He
                                            concluded that everything a person does is to achieve happiness of some
                                            kind. Sometimes they are successful, and sometimes they are unsuccessful,
                                            but happiness is always the target each person aims at. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                            &nbsp &nbspHe concluded that every act is merely an interim step in the
                                            direction of happiness. For example, you want to get a good job.Why? So you
                                            can earn good money.Why? So you can get a comfortable home and a nice
                                            car.Why? So you can have good relationships and a nice family. Why? So that
                                            you can have a satisfying home life. Why? The final answer, the ultimate
                                            goal, is so that you can be happy. Everything that you or anyone else does
                                            is aimed at happiness, however you define it and however successful you are
                                            at achieving it. <br><br>
                                        <li><b>THE ROLE OF GOODNESS</b>
                                          <p> <br>One of Aristotle's greatest insights on the subject of happiness was
                                            his conclusion that ''Only the good can be happy, and only the virtuous can
                                            be good.'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThis is one of the most important
                                            observations in the history of human thought and experience. ''Only the good
                                            can be happy, and only the virtuous can be good.'' <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                            &nbspWhat I have found in my many years of research into philosophy and
                                            psychology is that only people who are genuinely good inside can be happy
                                            for any period of time. And in my years of study of the foundation qualities
                                            of self-confidence, I have found that only men and women with clear,
                                            positive values are able to develop the kind of unshakable self-confidence
                                            that makes it possible for them to deal effectively with anything that
                                            happens to them. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe fastest way for you to
                                            build or to regain your self-confidence is to become absolutely clear about
                                            your deepest values and convictions, and then begin to live by them. The
                                            solution to almost all human problems is a return to values. In many ways,
                                            your unhappiness and stress are caused by your drifting away from doing and
                                            saying the things that you know are right. <br><br>
                                        <li><b>INTEGRITY IS ESSENTIAL</b>
                                          <p> <br>The most important single quality for success is the quality of
                                            <i>integrity.</i> Aristotle insisted that only a life based on values such
                                            as integrity, honesty, courage, generosity, persistence, and sincerity would
                                            lead to happiness and personal fulfillment. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspI
                                            used to think of integrity as only one of the key values, equal to and
                                            separate from the others.Then one day a wise and wealthy man pointed out to
                                            me that integrity is really the value that guarantees all the others.
                                            <i>Integrity is the foundation value on which all of your other values are
                                              based. Having true integrity means that you always live and act
                                              consistently with your values. If you lack integrity, you will compromise
                                              your other values at the slightest temptation.</i> <br><br>

                                        <li><b>ORGANIZE YOUR VALUES</b>
                                          <p> <br>Once you have defined your values, you should organize them in order
                                            of priority.To start, you need only three to five key values to create a
                                            foundation for your character and personality. These are the values that you
                                            personally consider to be more important than any others. The order in which
                                            you arrange your values is terribly important as well. This ranking of
                                            values largely determines the kind of person you are, and the kind of life
                                            you live. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspEverything you do is the result of
                                            a choice.You are constantly making choices of one kind or another, to do one
                                            thing or to do something else. This ability to make choices distinguishes
                                            you from all other creatures. Each choice you make is based on your primary
                                            values at that time. Each action is based on what you consider to be the
                                            most important value at that moment of choice. <br><br>
                                        <li><b>ACT ON YOUR VALUES</b>
                                          <p> <br>When you choose, your higher-order values always take precedence over
                                            your lower-order values. Every act you take, every decision you make, is
                                            based on your dominant value at that time.You can do only one thing at a
                                            time, and you always have to choose what it is going to be.You always choose
                                            what is most valuable to you at that particular moment. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                            &nbsp &nbspHow can you tell what your values are? It's simple.Your values
                                            are only and always expressed in your <i>actions.</i> It is what you do
                                            rather than what you say that tells you, and others, what you value most.
                                            Especially, it is what you do <i>under pressure</i>, when you are forced to
                                            choose, that reveals your true values and beliefs about yourself and the
                                            world around you. <br><br>
                                        <li><b>THE DETERMINANT OF PERSONALITY</b>
                                          <p> <br>Both your choice of values and the order of your values are critical
                                            in determining your personality and your life. Here is an example. Imagine
                                            that two people have each been through a values clarification exercise and
                                            settled upon the same three values. Only the order is different.
                                            <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspPerson A has decided that his top three
                                            values, in order of importance, are first, family; second, health; and
                                            third, career success. This person is saying that he puts his family ahead
                                            of his health and career, and his health ahead of his career. This means
                                            that if he has to choose between family and career, family comes first. If
                                            he has to choose between health and career, health comes first.
                                            <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspPerson B has the same three values, except
                                            that his values are in a slightly different order. His first value is career
                                            success. His second value is his family, and his third value is health.
                                            <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThis means that Person B will put his career
                                            ahead of his family if he has to choose. He will put his career and his
                                            family ahead of his health if he has to choose. <br><br>
                                        <li><b>THE BIG QUESTION</b>
                                          <p> <br>Now here are some questions for you. Will there be a difference
                                            between Person A and Person B? Will there be a <i>small</i> difference or a
                                            <i>large</i> difference? Would you prefer to be friends with Person A or
                                            with Person B? Would you be able to tell Person A from Person B if you met
                                            them socially or in business? <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe answer is
                                            that Person B, who chooses career success as his primary value, will be a
                                            totally different human being from Person A, who decides that his family is
                                            most important to him. The order of family, health, and career is a
                                            life-enriching organization of values. A person who lives his life
                                            consistent with these values will be a far happier person than a person who
                                            places his career ahead of his family and especially ahead of his health.
                                            This is why you must select both your values and their order of importance
                                            with care.Your values and their order determine your whole life. <br><br>
                                        <li><b>INTEGRITY IS A WAY OF LIVING</b>
                                          <p> <br>Once you have determined your values, your level of integrity can be
                                            measured by how rigidly you adhere to them. A value is not something that
                                            you compromise when it is convenient. Either you have it or you do not.Your
                                            choice of values and your resolution to live by those values form your
                                            character and your personality. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThroughout
                                            history, great men and women have been men and women of character. They have
                                            been people who lived on the basis of high and noble values.They have been
                                            honored and respected for the values they stood for and represented.
                                            <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOne of the great problems in our society
                                            today is the phenomenon of ''situational values'' or ''situational ethics.''
                                            These are the result of people changing their ideas of right and wrong
                                            depending on the situation, and often the temptation of the moment.What is
                                            even worse is when they fool themselves into believing that they are people
                                            of character when they are really only people of convenience. <br><br>
                                        <li><b>WHAT YOU DO UNDER PRESSURE</b>
                                          <p> <br>Situational values are demonstrated when people say they believe in
                                            one thing, but they do another. They say that they believe in telling the
                                            truth, but then they lie when it is convenient, or excuse the lies of
                                            another. An individual is defined by what he or she does, not what he or she
                                            <i>says</i>. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspSome people are confused by
                                            their emotions. They believe that if their <i>intentions</i> are sincere,
                                            their <i>actions</i> don't matter. They feel that if they wish or hope
                                            something, it is the same as actually doing it. But it is only what you
                                            actually do when you are forced to choose, especially under pressure, that
                                            tells you who you really are inside. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIt is
                                            vital to your success and happiness that you are impeccably <i>honest</i>
                                            with everyone you know and deal with, both in your personal life and in your
                                            career. There is nothing that will earn you the support of people faster
                                            than for you to develop the reputation of being a person of character and
                                            integrity. At the same time, there is nothing that will damage your
                                            reputation and sabotage your career faster than for you to get the
                                            reputation of being the kind of person that others cannot trust or rely on.

                                            you. As Polonius says in Shakespeare's <i>Hamlet, ''To thine own self be

                                            with your always living in truth with yourself. You do not delude yourself
                                            or play games with your own mind.You don't try to believe things that are

                                            truthful, straightforward, and honest with everyone in your life. Just as
                                            you are true to yourself, you are true to others as well.You <i>live in

                                            &nbspIf you ask people whether they are honest, almost everyone will say
                                            that they are. Most people do not lie, cheat, steal, or engage in dishonest

                                            guidance that always comes.When you get an idea or insight into the right
                                            thing to do, you put it into action. You trust your higher mind. This is the

                                        <li><b>THE INTEGRITY OF YOUR OWN MIND</b>
                                          <p> <br>Ralph Waldo Emerson, in his essay ''Self-Reliance,'' said, <i>''Guard
                                              your integrity as a sacred thing.''</i> He went on to say, <i>''Nothing is
                                              at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind.''</i> <br><br>&nbsp
                                            &nbsp &nbsp &nbspTruthfulness is the indispensable requirement for the
                                            development of character, and the development of character must be a central
                                            aim of your life. Aristotle said, <i>''The purpose of education is the
                                              development of the character of the young.''</i>Today, in the United
                                            States, many young people have not been brought up with a clear sense of
                                            right and wrong. Many people have been told that values are relative. Many
                                            people have been told, for example, that if they like to shoplift, then that
                                            particular value is just as good as a person who believes that shoplifting
                                            is wrong. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThis form of value relativity leads
                                            down a blind alley. It leads to failure, frustration, and unhappiness. The
                                            fact is that values are not relative. There are values that are
                                            <i>life-enhancing</i> and there are values that are <i>life-destroying.</i>
                                            If a value is positive, living by it improves the quality of your life and
                                            your relationships with others. A negative value hurts your relationships
                                            and detracts from the quality of your life. You can easily tell the
                                            difference, because living by a positive value makes you feel happy, and
                                            practicing a negative value makes you feel unhappy. <br><br>
                                        <li><b>FACE THE TRUTH</b>
                                          <p> <br>Living in truth means that you face the truth about yourself and the
                                            world around you. You face the truth about your work and your relationships.
                                            You look yourself directly in the eye and you live consistently with your
                                            innermost convictions.You do not play games with yourself or wish and hope
                                            that things could be different than they are. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                            &nbspIntegrity means that you accept that your world can only get better
                                            when you get better. No one is going to come along and change things for
                                            you. If you want things to change, you are going to have to make the changes
                                            yourself. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIntegrity means that you accept
                                            that your marriage gets better only when you become a better spouse. Your
                                            business gets better only when you become a better manager or executive.Your
                                            sales results and customers get better only when you become a better
                                            salesperson. Your financial life improves only when you become more
                                            intelligent and disciplined about money. <br><br>
                                        <li><b>ACCEPT PEOPLE THE WAY THEY ARE</b>
                                          <p> <br>Especially, honesty means that you accept people the way they are, not
                                            demanding that they be the way you want. You do not go through life wishing,
                                            hoping, and expecting that people will change and be different so as to suit
                                            you. One of the basic principles of human life is that, with few exceptions,
                                            <i>people don't change.</i> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn fact, under
                                            pressure, people not only do not change, but they become even more of what
                                            they already are inside. If a person has a difficult personality, under
                                            pressure he will become even more difficult. If someone is stubborn or
                                            inflexible, when she is put under pressure she will become even more
                                            stubborn and inflexible. If a person is slightly dishonest, when he is
                                            subjected to pressure or temptation he will become totally dishonest. People
                                            don't change. <br><br>
                                        <li><b>BUSINESS AND COMPETITION</b>
                                          <p> <br>Honesty in our fast-moving world also means that you see the world of
                                            business and competition as it is, not as you wish it were, especially with
                                            regard to the explosion of information and technology. Many people think
                                            that they can make a token effort to keep up with the growth of knowledge in
                                            their field and the growth of technology in their work. But this minimum
                                            effort is not acceptable to the honest person. The truly honest person
                                            realizes that today you have to run just to stay in the same place. The
                                            truly honest person realizes that knowledge is doubling in every field every
                                            two to three years, and this means that your knowledge has to double every
                                            two to three years as well. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspJack Welch, the
                                            past president and CEO of General Electric, once said, ''If the rate of
                                            change outside your organization is greater than the rate of change inside
                                            your organization, the end is in sight.'' This principle applies to you as a
                                            person as well. If you are not continually learning and upgrading your
                                            skills, you are in danger of becoming obsolete. <br><br>
                                        <li><b>WHAT ARE YOU WORTH?</b>
                                          <p> <br>All over the country today, people are being laid off or fired by the
                                            thousands, and even hundreds of thousands, each year. In many cases, these
                                            people have allowed their levels of knowledge and skill to decline to the
                                            point where their companies could no longer afford to keep them on the
                                            payroll. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspMany of them were not completely
                                            honest with themselves. They did not continually upgrade their knowledge and
                                            skills so they could continue to add more and more value to their companies.
                                            They hoped that the dramatic changes taking place in the national and
                                            international economies would not affect them. And as a result, they got
                                            caught in the layoffs when the market for their products or services slowed
                                            down. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIt takes the average white-collar
                                            professional two to seven months to find another job, usually taking a pay
                                            cut of 14 to 40 percent. Some people get laid off from highly paid jobs and
                                            never make that kind of money again. And if they don't get busy upgrading
                                            their knowledge and skills, it can happen again. <br><br>
                                        <li><b>FOCUS ON ADDING VALUE</b>
                                          <p> <br>Honesty means that you accept that your income is totally determined
                                            by your ability to contribute value to your company and, through your
                                            company, to your customers. An individual must generate three dollars of
                                            bottom-line profit for every dollar of salary or income that the person
                                            earns from the company. If you are not currently generating three dollars of
                                            profit or cost savings to the bottom line for your company, your job is a
                                            prime candidate for outsourcing, downsizing, or eliminating. Honesty means
                                            that you accept this as a fact and then do everything in your power to
                                            maintain and increase your value. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspTrue
                                            honesty means that you never expect to get out more than you put in.You
                                            never expect to get something for nothing.You don't gamble or buy lottery
                                            tickets, which in a way is an act of dishonesty. It is an attempt to get
                                            something that you have not earned. The truly honest person never attempts
                                            to get rewards without working, or to get rich quick or easy. <br><br>&nbsp

                                            want new and better jobs, and they want them immediately. They are always
                                            looking for shortcuts, and as a result they are always frustrated and
                                            unhappy. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThey hope that problems that have
                                            taken many months and years to develop can be solved with a <i>silver
                                              bullet</i> of some kind.They are impatient and they want immediate
                                            results. But being an honest person requires that you resist the temptation
                                            of the quick fix in any part of your life. <br><br>

                                          <p> <br>Relationships are central to a happy, healthy, satisfying life. All
                                            relationships are based on trust. Trust is the glue that holds relationships
                                            together. You can have all kinds of problems and disagreements with another
                                            person, but as long as the trust and respect are still there, the
                                            relationship can endure. But, if anything ever happens to the trust, the
                                            relationship can fall apart quickly, like a house of cards collapsing.
                                            <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAll business relationships are based on

                                            borrower or the creditor. All relationships with your bankers, your
                                            suppliers, your customers, your staff, and everyone else in your financial

                                            were forced into bankruptcy because of the economic downturn. But the
                                            outcomes of their bankruptcies were completely different. <br><br>&nbsp
                                            &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe first of my friends had been meticulously careful about
                                            all of his bills and finances throughout his career. He had always paid at
                                            least the minimum amounts on his charge cards. If ever he had a financial
                                            problem, he went to the person affected and rearranged payments and

                                            unexpected financial default over which he had no control, he had no choice
                                            but to go to court, give up all his assets, and walk away penniless.
                                            <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspBut within a week, people were approaching
                                            him and offering him money, loans, offices, credit cards, a place to live,
                                            and a new car. One of his previous business associates, quite wealthy,
                                            mailed him a blank check already signed, saying, ''Just fill in the amount
                                            you need and let me know for my records; I have complete faith in you.''
                                            Aside from removing a great burden of debt from him, his bankruptcy hardly
                                            affected him at all. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe second businessman,
                                            however, had a completely different experience. When he started to have
                                            financial problems, he continually misled and deceived his creditors, people
                                            who had trusted him. He neglected to make payments he had promised, and
                                            wrote checks that he couldn't cover. He avoided his creditors when they
                                            phoned, and he eventually changed his telephone number. He moved and didn't
                                            tell anyone his new address. He treated people who had trusted him by
                                            lending him money as if they were stupid. When he finally went bankrupt, no
                                            one wanted anything to do with him. It will take him years to recover, if he
                                            ever does. He can't even get a credit card; he now has to pay cash for
                                            everything. <br><br>
                                        <li><b>THE KEY TO SALES SUCCESS</b>
                                          <p> <br>In sales, trust is the foundation of all relationships. A person will
                                            not buy from you until he or she trusts you completely. All top salespeople
                                            invest a good deal of time building high-quality, trusting relationships
                                            with their clients before they ever attempt to sell their products or
                                            services. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAn association to which I belong
                                            commissioned a $50,000 survey of customers last year. Since most of our
                                            organizations sell forms of training and consulting services that are
                                            somewhat similar, they wanted to find out what caused a purchaser to buy
                                            from one company and not another. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOne of the
                                            questions they asked the customers was what they were most concerned with in
                                            making a buying decision. More than 80 percent of the respondents to the
                                            survey said that the honesty and integrity of the salesperson was more
                                            important than any other factor. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen they
                                            asked them what they meant by honesty and integrity in a salesperson, the
                                            customers replied that this meant that the salesperson put their interests
                                            first. They believed that the salesperson would keep his or her word. They
                                            believed the salesperson's claims about the product. They believed that the
                                            salesperson would do what he or she promised, and that the company would
                                            fulfill any commitments that the salesperson made. They had a high level of
                                            confidence in the word of the salesperson and in everything that he or she
                                            did or said in interactions with them. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAn
                                            interesting fact that came out of this survey was that the quality of the
                                            product or service was hardly mentioned. When customers were asked about
                                            their concerns over product quality, they replied that they felt that most
                                            products or services at a particular level were fairly similar and would
                                            achieve the results offered. The key to the sale was how they felt about the
                                            character of the salesperson, and through the salesperson, the company
                                            itself. <br><br>
                                        <li><b>TRUTHFULNESS IS THE KEY TO CHARACTER</b>
                                          <p> <br>The real essence of character, and the most recognizable expression of
                                            honesty and integrity, is <i>truthfulness.</i> If you are completely
                                            truthful with yourself and others, you will almost always be viewed as a
                                            person of high character. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn our society, men
                                            and women of character seem to attract opportunities. Doors are opened for
                                            them wherever they go. They are introduced to people who can help them.
                                            Money and other resources are made available to them. This is why the most
                                            important quality you can instill in your children is a sense of honesty and
                                            the habit of truthfulness in everything they do or say. <br><br>
                                        <li><b>PARENTS AND CHILDREN</b>
                                          <p> <br>I have four children. Each of my children has been brought up having
                                            the importance of truthfulness drummed into them from an early age.Today,
                                            all four of them are adamant truth tellers.They are completely honest. I can
                                            ask them any question and they will always tell me the truth. <br><br>&nbsp
                                            &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen they were growing up, I made them each a promise. I
                                            said, ''You will never get into trouble with me for telling the truth.'' And
                                            I kept my word. When they did something foolish, as all children do, I would
                                            listen to their stories without judging or criticizing and then ask, ''Well,
                                            what did you learn?'' They soon learned that they could always tell the
                                            truth and never suffer criticism or disapproval. They loved it.
                                            <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspSometimes they fool around, but all I have to
                                            do is ask them for the truth and they will always give it to me, whatever it
                                            is. I'm very proud of them. It is absolutely amazing how much better
                                            relationships are between parents and children when they absolutely trust
                                            each other. <br><br>
                                        <li><b>HUSBANDS AND WIVES</b>
                                          <p> <br>What is true for communications between parents and children is even
                                            more important for husbands and wives. One of the best definitions of love
                                            that I have ever heard is by Ayn Rand: ''Love is a response to values.''
                                            <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYou love another person because he or she
                                            represents values that you respect and cherish. The other person embodies
                                            qualities that you admire. In short, you love another person for his or her
                                            character. All else will change or fade away over time, but character
                                            remains. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspTruthfulness and honesty between
                                            couples requires fidelity and straightforwardness between the two at all
                                            times. If a couple is ideally suited, they absolutely trust each other and
                                            are each other's best <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspfriends. There is no
                                            one that they would rather talk to or express themselves more honestly with
                                            than the other. Character, integrity, and honesty are the foundation
                                            qualities of a loving relationship, and are more important than anything
                                            else. <br><br>
                                        <li><b>THE UNIVERSAL MAXIM</b>
                                          <p> <br>There is a wonderful test that you can give yourself on a regular
                                            basis to measure whether an act is good or bad, right or wrong. It is simple
                                            and you can use it throughout life. It is based on the Universal Maxim of
                                            the German philosopher Immanuel Kant, postulated more than 200 years ago. He
                                            said that <i>you should live your life as though your every act were to
                                              become a universal law.</i> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn other words,
                                            before you make a decision or take an action, imagine that everyone else was
                                            going to do exactly the same thing. Imagine that your decision was going to
                                            become a law for yourself and everyone else. This is the true test of
                                            whether your decision is a good one. It is the true test of a value or
                                            behavior.What kind of society would we have if everyone lived and behaved

                                            debates over public and social policy. Governments would be slower to
                                            approve certain actions in the areas of crime, education, welfare, and
                                            business if there was a likelihood that everyone would engage in those

                                            First, ask yourself, <i>''What kind of a world would my world be if everyone
                                              in it were just like me?''</i> Just imagine! If everyone in the world were
                                            just like you, would this be a better world in which to live? If everyone in
                                            the world were just like you, would this be a happier, healthier, more
                                            prosperous, and more harmonious world - or not? <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                            &nbspThen, ask yourself, <i>''What kind of a country would my country be if
                                              everyone in it were just like me?''</i> What would this country be like if
                                            everybody in it behaved exactly the way you do? If everyone did the things

                                            are there some things that you might do differently? <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                            &nbsp &nbspThe third question you can ask yourself is, <i>''What kind of a

                                            Look around you in your company and ask yourself if your company would be
                                            more prosperous and harmonious if everybody in it did their work exactly the
                                            way you do your work all day long. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe final
                                            question that you can ask yourself is, <i>''What kind of a family would my
                                              family be if everyone in it was just like me?''</i> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                            &nbsp &nbspIf all the members of your family were just like you, would your
                                            family be a wonderful place to live and grow up in? Would everybody in your
                                            family thrive and be happier and more successful? Would you have the kind of
                                            family that other people would point to and admire and want to be like?

                                        <li><b>THE QUALITY OF COURAGE</b>
                                          <p> <br>In a review of 3,300 studies of leadership conducted by James
                                            McPherson over the years, he found a common denominator. It was the quality
                                            of courage. Winston Churchill once said, <i>''Courage is rightly considered
                                              the foremost of the virtues, for upon it, all others depend.''</i>
                                            <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYou have heard it said that the road to hell
                                            is paved with good intentions.The world is full of people with high and
                                            lofty goals and ambitions, but there are very few people who have the
                                            courage, the discipline, and the willpower to carry them out. <br><br>&nbsp
                                            &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe best part of practicing the quality of courage is that
                                            each time you behave courageously, you feel stronger and better about
                                            yourself.Your self-esteem increases and you like yourself more.You feel more
                                            confident and competent.You feel happier inside. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                            &nbspIn contrast, each time you compromise yourself in the area of courage
                                            your self-esteem goes down.You feel weaker and less competent. You don't
                                            like or respect yourself as much. <br><br>
                                        <li><b>DO THE THING YOU FEAR</b>
                                          <p> <br>A fundamental part of becoming personally powerful requires that you
                                            live consistently with the highest values you know, in every area of your
                                            life. These virtues and values not only are self-reinforcing, they also are
                                            self-rewarding.You get an immediate payoff of inner satisfaction each time
                                            you force yourself to do what you know you should do, even when you don't
                                            feel like it. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe fear of failure is the
                                            greatest single obstacle to success in adult life. The antidote to the fear
                                            of failure is the courage to take action. Courage is so important as a
                                            quality that, like physical fitness, it requires a series of exercises to
                                            build it and maintain it. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspYou best way to
                                            develop courage is by facing your fears. Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, <i>''Do
                                              the thing you fear, and the death of fear is certain.''</i> <br><br>&nbsp
                                            &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen you do the thing that you are afraid of, you take
                                            control over both your emotions and your life.You shift your attitude from
                                            neutral or negative to positive and optimistic. ''Do the thing you fear, and
                                            the death of fear is certain.'' <br><br>
                                        <li><b>PRACTICE SYSTEMATIC DESENSITIZATION</b>
                                          <p> <br>Many people fear public speaking. But Toastmasters International has
                                            developed a powerful method of teaching public speaking even to people who
                                            are absolutely terrified of the idea of standing up and speaking in front of
                                            others. It is the process of ''systematic desensitization.'' You can use it
                                            in every area of your life to reduce fear and build courage. <br><br>&nbsp
                                            &nbsp &nbsp &nbspSystematic desensitization is a psychological term that
                                            refers to your doing something over and over again until it no longer holds
                                            any fear for you. In Toastmasters International, each member is required to
                                            stand up and speak, even if just for a few seconds, at every meeting. After
                                            several months of weekly meetings, people who were so terrified of speaking
                                            in front of others that they could not lead silent prayer in a phone booth
                                            become so confident about their ability to stand up and speak in front of
                                            peers that they compete for longer opportunities to talk. <br><br>
                                        <li><b>SPEAK ON YOUR FEET</b>
                                          <p> <br>I have worked with countless executives who have taken my advice and
                                            joined Toastmasters International or taken a course from the Dale Carnegie
                                            organization. Within six months, they tell me that they are completely
                                            different people. From being shy and self-effacing at meetings and in
                                            presentations, they become calm, confident, bold, and even eloquent in
                                            expressing their points on their feet with other people. And their careers
                                            take off as well. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen you can speak on your
                                            feet, you appear to be smarter and more competent than a person who cannot.
                                            Many executives, both men and women, have seen their careers take off, their
                                            incomes increase, and their responsibilities expand as they faced their
                                            fears by speaking over and over again and until they became very good on
                                            their feet. <br><br>
                                        <li><b>TURN TOWARD DANGER</b>
                                          <p> <br>On the Serengeti Plain of Africa, zoologists have developed a simple
                                            technique to determine which one of the animals in the herd is the leader.
                                            <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen a predator - a lion or cheetah -
                                            approaches a herd of grazing animals, the members of the herd pick up the
                                            scent in the wind and begin drifting away in the opposite direction. At this
                                            time, the leader of the herd will emerge.The leader will be the animal that
                                            places himself between the predator and the herd while the herd begins to
                                            flee.The leader, risking his life facing the lion or cheetah that is moving
                                            in on the herd, will nonetheless stand his ground to buy time for the others
                                            to escape. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe leader always ''turns toward
                                            danger.''This is as true for human beings as it is for animals.You become a
                                            leader to the degree to which you force yourself to turn toward danger as
                                            well. You identify the areas in your life that cause you fear and stress,
                                            and instead of avoiding them and hoping that they will go away, you confront
                                            them directly. <br><br>
                                        <li><b>DO IT ANYWAY</b>
                                          <p> <br>The actor Glenn Ford once said, <i>''If you do not do the thing you
                                              fear, the fear controls your life.''</i> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIt
                                            is almost as if the fear is the puppeteer and you are the puppet. If you
                                            don't deal with the fear,and cut the strings that hold you to the fear, the
                                            fear will cause you to dance emotionally and psychologically. If you let a
                                            fear go on for too long, it will tend to grow and grow and eventually come
                                            to dominate all of your thinking. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspEach time
                                            you think of the fearful situation or person, your heart will beat faster
                                            and your stomach will churn.You will be unable to sleep well at night. The
                                            fear will affect your health, your happiness, your relationships, and your
                                            interactions with your customers and coworkers. Over time, you will become
                                            so preoccupied with the fearinducing situation that you will not be able to
                                            think of anything else. This is no way to live. <br><br>
                                        <li><b>FACE THE FEAR</b>
                                          <p> <br>The way you deal with fear is to confront the fear.You resolve to face
                                            the fear, deal with the fear, and put an end to the fear. <br><br>&nbsp
                                            &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen I was a young man and confronted with a fearful
                                            situation, I read a quote from Mark Twain that changed my attitude forever.
                                            It said, <i>''Courage is not lack of fear or absence of fear. It is mastery
                                              of fear, control of fear.''</i> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThose words
                                            had an enormous impact on me. I realized that we are all afraid of many
                                            things.To be afraid is normal and natural. In fact, the more intelligent you
                                            are, the greater number of possible fears you will have.You will have a
                                            greater sensitivity to your world and to the things it is logical for you to
                                            fear. <br><br>
                                        <li><b>MOVE TOWARD THE FEAR</b>
                                          <p> <br>The only difference between the brave person and the coward is that
                                            the brave person confronts the fear and deals with it while the coward turns
                                            from the fear and flees from it. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAnd here is
                                            a great discovery. When you confront a fear and move toward it, it
                                            diminishes and grows smaller. It loses its hold over you. But if you back
                                            away from a fear, it grows larger and soon takes control of your thoughts
                                            and feelings. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhen you habitually turn toward
                                            danger, do the thing you fear, face the fear, and move toward it bravely, it
                                            loses its power to affect you. Soon you dominate the fear rather than having
                                            it dominate you. You feel a tremendous sense of control. The quality that
                                            you need to face your fears, more than anything else, is the quality of
                                            self-discipline. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWonderfully enough, when you
                                            discipline yourself to face your fears, to act courageously, even when you
                                            don't feel like it, your fear situation goes away. You will feel terrific
                                            about yourself. You will have a sense of power and control over your life.

                                            your goal. It is the ability and willingness for you to set a goal and then
                                            take the first step in the direction of achieving it. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp
                                            &nbsp &nbspIn a 12-year study at Babson College, entrepreneurial instructor
                                            Dr. Robert Ronstadt searched for the reasons for success or failure among
                                            the graduates of the business school. Some went on to build successful
                                            businesses, but most did not. He discovered that those who built successful
                                            businesses had a special quality. It was that they had the courage to launch
                                            their businesses with no guarantees of success. They were willing to risk

                                            &nbspProfessor Ronstadt called this the ''corridor principle.'' He said that
                                            when you launch toward your goal, however distant, you begin to move down a
                                            corridor of time. As you move down this corridor, other doors of opportunity
                                            will open up on either side of you. But you would not have been able to see
                                            these other doors of opportunity if you were not already in motion down this
                                            psychological corridor toward your goal. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspMost
                                            people who succeed in life achieve their success in an area completely
                                            different from the field in which they started off. But because they were in
                                            motion, they saw opportunities and possibilities that they would not have
                                            been aware of if they had waited until everything was just right. And the
                                            fact is that everything will never be just right. <br><br>

                                          <p> <br>If the first part of courage is the willingness to <i>begin;</i> the
                                            second part of courage is the willingness to <i>endure</i>. It is the
                                            courage to hang in there. It is the courage to stay the course. It is the
                                            courage to persist in the face of every setback and difficulty.
                                            <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspSelf-discipline is the iron quality of
                                            character. It is what enables you to endure. Self-discipline is the one
                                            quality that gives you the strength that you need to take risks and to move
                                            forward in the face of danger and uncertainty. It is self-discipline, and
                                            the courage that comes from self-discipline, that develops personal power
                                            within you that enables you to overcome any obstacle in your way. <br><br>

                                          <ol> <br>There are several forms of courage that you can develop with
                                            practice. These forms of courage will help you to achieve the great success
                                            that is possible for you. They are all learnable with practice. <br>
                                            <li><b>Dream Big Dreams</b> <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe first form of
                                              courage is the courage to dream big dreams and to set big goals. This is
                                              where most people are stopped. The very idea of setting big, challenging,
                                              exciting, worthwhile goals is so overwhelming that they quit before they
                                              even begin. But this is not for you. Sit down, write out your goals as if
                                              anything were possible for you, and never be afraid to dream big dreams.

                                              of courage is the courage to make a total commitment, throwing yourself
                                              wholeheartedly into whatever it is you decide to do. All successful people
                                              of my experience are people who are living fully engaged. They are fully
                                              involved in their lives and in their goals. They don't do things by half
                                              measures. They may have no guarantees, but they are not afraid to put
                                              their whole hearts into their activities. If they fail, they fail by
                                              trying greatly, not by playing it safe, wishing and hoping that everything
                                              will work out all right. <br>

                                              zone. It is the courage to move into your zone of discomfort, where you
                                              feel awkward, clumsy, and alone. The comfort zone is one of the greatest
                                              enemies of human potential. When people get into a comfort zone, they
                                              strive to stay in that comfort zone. Often their whole lives pass them by
                                              while they are furnishing and reinforcing their little rut of medium

                                              ambitions.You need to be willing to face discomfort in order for you to

                                              courage to launch in faith with no guarantees of success. Someone once
                                              wrote, <i>''If every obstacle must first be overcome, nothing will ever

                                              in success. However, if you look upon every step forward as a learning
                                              experience and every setback as a valuable lesson that has been sent to
                                              you to make you stronger and better, you will not be afraid to launch in

                                              disappointments, and temporary defeats. You need to learn to deal with
                                              failure by realizing that it is an in dispensable prerequisite for

                                              intelligently begin again. You need to overcome the fear of failure by
                                              doing the things you fear over and over again, and then by resolving to
                                              bounce rather than break when things don't work out for you. <br><br>&nbsp

                                              clear goals, you will always be failing and falling in a forward
                                              direction. You will always be picking yourself up a little bit closer to

                                              a mistake, they accept it, learn as much as possible from it, and then

                                              something goes wrong, you focus on the solution rather than the

                                              ''courageous patience.'' This is a special kind of courage that is
                                              required after you have launched toward your goal but you have not yet
                                              seen any results. It is amazing how many people break and run in that zone
                                              between when they begin and when they start to see a payoff. Their doubts
                                              and fears overwhelm them. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspBut this is not
                                              for you. Once you have started toward your goal, resolve to remain calm
                                              and confident until you start to get results. Be patient and persistent,

                                              you need is the courage to persist longer than anyone else. Persistence is
                                              the quality that will ultimately guarantee your success.Your willingness
                                              to persist in the face of every adversity can be your greatest asset. It

                                              and over. No one was ever defeated until they accepted defeat as a

                                              you feel like it or not, and you use this inner strength to build high
                                              levels of courage and persistence within yourself, you will become an
                                              incredibly powerful person.You will soon feel that there is nothing that
                                              you cannot accomplish.You will eventually develop yourself to the point

                                                    They keep themselves positive by looking for the bright side, the

                                                      and talk about where they are going, rather than about what has
                                                      happened in the past. They create a clear, exciting future vision
                                                      of what is possible for them. By the Law of Attraction, they find

                                                      about their goals much of the time. Once they have dreamed and
                                                      fantasized about their ideal future visions, they boil them down
                                                      into clear, written goals and plans that they work on every day.
                                                      They focus their attention and concentrate their energies. They

                                                      of people in their field, whatever it is.They identify their key

                                                      the solution rather than the problem. They think about what needs
                                                      to be done rather than who is to blame. They use creative thinking

                                                      them. They view their goals as problems to be solved, and they

                                                      They carefully plan each day in advance. They set clear priorities
                                                      on their activities. They then work on those tasks that represent
                                                      the most valuable use of their time.They plow through enormous

                                                      Because they are so effective and efficient, they get more done,
                                                      they move ahead faster, and they make a greater contribution to

                                                      seminars. They are determined to stay at the cutting edge of their

                                                      the most successful people are intensely action-oriented. They

                                                      more done than the average person. The more they get done, the

                                                        <br>The writing of this book has taken many years of work,
                                                        reading, teaching, and experience. Many people have contributed
                                                        to my thinking and have been invisible guides as these chapters
                                                        came together. I would like to first thank my friend Mark Victor
                                                        Hansen, who introduced me many years ago to Emmet Fox, perhaps
                                                        the finest spiritual thinker of the twentieth century. Ernest
                                                        Holmes, founder of Science of Mind, opened my eyes and heart to
                                                        the incredible universe of potential contained within each
                                                        person when they <i>changed their thinking and changed their
                                                          lives.</i> Great spiritual teachers such as Charles Fillmore,
                                                        Neville, Eric Butterworth, Wayne Dyer, and Roberto Assagioli
                                                        have had a profound influence on my thinking. <br><br>&nbsp
                                                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbspI would also like to thank those great
                                                        practical thinkers on success who have had such a wonderful
                                                        influence on me - and on the world - such as Napoleon Hill,
                                                        Maxwell Maltz, Claude Bristol, David Schwarz,W. Clement Stone,

                                                        Charlie Jones. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspBusiness thinkers
                                                        such as Peter Drucker, Andrew Grove, Ken Blanchard,Warren
                                                        Bennis,Tom Peters, Nido Qubein, and Marshall Goldsmith have
                                                        greatly enriched me with their ideas and insights. <br><br>&nbsp
                                                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbspI would like to thank my editor, Matthew Holt
                                                        of John Wiley & Sons, for his unflinching support of this book,
                                                        and his constant encouragement over the many months that it has
                                                        taken to write and edit. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspNot
                                                        least, I thank my wonderful wife Barbara and my fabulous
                                                        children - Christina, Michael, David, and Catherine - for their
                                                        support and patience during the long hours away from them to
                                                        finish this book.
