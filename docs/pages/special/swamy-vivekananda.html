            <p class="has-line-data">“ God is to be worshipped as the one beloved, dearer than everything in this and
              next life.” ― <b> Swami
                Vivekananda </b></p>

            <p class="has-line-data">“ Those who work at a thing heart and soul not only achieve success in it but
              through their absorption in
              that
              they also realize the supreme truth-Brahman. Those who work at a thing with their whole heart receive help
              from
              God.” ― <b> Swami Vivekananda </b></p>

            <p class="has-line-data">“ Come out into the universe of light. Everything in the universe is yours. Stretch
              out your arms and
              embrace it
              with love. If you ever felt you wanted to do that, you have felt God.” ― <b> Swami Vivekananda </b></p>

            <p class="has-line-data">“ You cannot believe in God until you believe in yourself.” ― <b> Swami Vivekananda
              </b></p>

            <p class="has-line-data">“ Each soul is potentially divine. The goal is to manifest this divinity within by
              controlling nature ,
              external
              and internal. Do this either by work , or worship or psychic control or philosophy – by one or more or all
              of
              these and be free.” ― <b> Swami Vivekananda </b></p>

            <p class="has-line-data">“ The varieties of religious belief are an advantage, since all faiths are good, so
              far as they encourage
              us to
              lead a religious life. The more sects there are, the more opportunities there are for making a successful
              appeal
              to the divine instinct in all of us.” ― <b> Swami Vivekananda </b></p>

            <p class="has-line-data">“ A few heart-whole, sincere, and energetic men and women can do more in a year
              than a mob in a century.”
              ― <b>
                Swami Vivekananda </b></p>

            <p class="has-line-data">“ Who is Helping You, Don’t Forget them.
              Who is Loving you, Don’t Hate them.
              Who is Believing you, Don’t Cheat them.” ― <b> Swami Vivekananda </b></p>

            <p class="has-line-data">“ Face the brutes.’ That is a lesson for all life-face the terrible, face it
              boldly. Like the monkeys,
              the
              hardships of life fall back when we cease to flee before them.” ― <b> Swami Vivekananda </b></p>

            <p class="has-line-data">“ We are what our thoughts have made us; so take care about what you think. Words
              are secondary. Thoughts
              live;
              they travel far.” ― <b> Swami Vivekananda </b></p>

            <p class="has-line-data">“ If you want to have life, you have to die every moment for it. Life and death are
              only different
              expressions of
              the same thing looked at from different standpoints; they are the falling and the rising of the same wave,
              and the
              two form one whole.” ― <b> Swami Vivekananda </b></p>

            <p class="has-line-data">“ In a day, when you don’t come across any problems – you can be sure that you are
              travelling in a wrong
              path.” ―
              <b> Swami Vivekananda </b></p>

            <p class="has-line-data">“ You have to grow from the inside out. None can teach you, none can make you
              spiritual. There is no
              other
              teacher but your own soul.” ― <b> Swami Vivekananda </b></p>

            <p class="has-line-data">“ I am the thread that runs through all these pearls,and each pearl is a religion
              or even a sect thereof.
              Such
              are the different pearls, and God is the thread that runs through all of them; most people, however, are
              entirely
              unconscious of it.” ― <b> Swami Vivekananda </b></p>

            <p class="has-line-data">“ I do not want to get material life, do not want the sense-life, but something
              higher.That is
              renunciation.
              Then, by the power of meditation, undo the mischief that has been done.” ― <b> Swami Vivekananda </b></p>

            <p class="has-line-data">“ Make that one idea your life; dream of it; think of it; live on that idea. Let
              the brain, the body,
              muscles,
              nerve… … Let the brain, the body, muscles, nerves, every part of your body be full of that idea, and just
              leave
              every other idea alone. This is the way to success, and this is the way great spiritual giants are
              produced.” ―
              <b> Swami Vivekananda </b></p>

            <p class="has-line-data">“ In a day, when you don’t come across any problems – you can be sure that you are
              travelling in a wrong
              path.” ―
              <b> Swami Vivekananda </b></p>

            <p class="has-line-data">“ This life is a hard fact; work your way through it boldly, though it may be
              adamantine; no matter, the
              soul is
              stronger.” ― <b> Swami Vivekananda </b></p>

            <p class="has-line-data">“ They alone live, who live for others.” ― <b> Swami Vivekananda </b></p>

              Swami Vivekanand Qoutes Set -2</h2>

            <p class="has-line-data">“ Perfection does not come from belief or faith. Talk does not count for anything.
              Parrots can do that.
              Perfection comes through selfless work.” ― <b> Swami Vivekananda </b></p>

            <p class="has-line-data">“ Even the greatest fool can accomplish a task if it were after his or her heart.
              But the intelligent
              ones are
              those who can convert every work into one that suits their taste.” ― <b> Swami Vivekananda </b></p>

            <p class="has-line-data">“ This life is a hard fact; work your way through it boldly, though it may be
              adamantine; no matter, the
              soul is
              stronger.” ― <b> Swami Vivekananda </b></p>

            <p class="has-line-data">“ Be perfectly resigned, perfectly unconcerned; then alone can you do any true
              work. No eyes can see the
              real
              forces; we can only see the results. Put out self, forget it; just let God work, it is His business.” ―
              <b> Swami
                Vivekananda </b></p>

            <p class="has-line-data">“ Each work has to pass through these stages-ridicule, opposition, and then
              acceptance. Those who think
              ahead of
              their time are sure to be misunderstood.” ― <b> Swami Vivekananda </b></p>

            <p class="has-line-data">“ The less passion there is, the better we work. The calmer we are, the better for
              us, and the more the
              amount of
              work we can do. When we let loose our feelings, we waste so much energy, shatter our nerves, disturb our
              minds,
              and accomplish very little work.” ― <b> Swami Vivekananda </b></p>
            <p class="has-line-data">“ Every individual is a center for the manifestation of a certain force. This force
              has been stored up as
              the
              resultant of our previous works, and each one of us is born with this force at our back.” ― <b> Swami
                Vivekananda
              </b></p>
            <p class="has-line-data">“ Fill the brain with high thoughts, highest ideals, place them day and night
              before you, and out of that
              will
              come great work.” ― <b> Swami Vivekananda </b></p>
            <p class="has-line-data">“ Great work requires great and persistent effort for a long time. … Character has
              to be established
              through a
              thousand stumbles.” ― <b> Swami Vivekananda </b></p>

            <p class="has-line-data">“ In a conflict between the heart and the brain, follow your heart.” ― <b> Swami
                Vivekananda </b></p>
            <p class="has-line-data">“ Anything that makes weak – physically, intellectually and spiritually, reject it
              as poison.” ― <b>
                Swami
                Vivekananda </b></p>
            <p class="has-line-data">“ Strength is the sign of vigor, the sign of life, the sign of hope, the sign of
              health, and the sign of
              everything that is good. As long as the body lives, there must be strength in the body, strength in the
              mind,
              strength in the hand.” ― <b> Swami Vivekananda </b></p>
            <p class="has-line-data">“ All knowledge that the world has ever received comes from the mind; the infinite
              library of the
              universe is in
              your own mind.” ― <b> Swami Vivekananda </b></p>

            <p class="has-line-data">“ We are what our thoughts have made us; so take care about what you think. Words
              are secondary. Thoughts

              they travel far.” ― <b> Swami Vivekananda </b></p>

            <p class="has-line-data">“ If the mind is intensely eager, everything can be accomplished-mountains can be
              crumbled into atom.” ―
              <b>
                Swami Vivekananda </b></p>

            <p class="has-line-data">“ Condemn none: if you can stretch out a helping hand, do so. If you cannot, fold
              your hands, bless your
              brothers, and let them go their own way.” ― <b> Swami Vivekananda </b></p>

            <p class="has-line-data">“ Stand up, be bold, be strong. Take the whole responsibility on your own
              shoulders, and know that you
              are the
              creator of your own destiny. All the strength and succor you want is within yourself.” ― <b> Swami

            <div class="panel">

              <p class="has-line-data">“ The whole secret of existence is to have no fear. Never fear what will become
                of you, depend on no
                one. Only
                the moment you reject all help are you freed.” ― <b> Swami Vivekananda </b></p>

              <p class="has-line-data">“ Fear is death, fear is sin, fear is hell, fear is unrighteousness, fear is
                wrong life. All the
                negative
                thoughts and ideas that are in the world have proceeded from this evil spirit of fear.” ― <b> Swami

              <p class="has-line-data">“ Be not Afraid of anything. You will do Marvelous work. it is Fearlessness that
