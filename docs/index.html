                        <h1 class="code-line"><a id="WebView_App_Documentation_0"></a>Topics</h1>
                        <h2 class="code-line"><a id="ch_1"></a> Organization</h2>

                        <p class="has-line-data">One of the most frequently mentioned habits of those who are successful
                            in life is organization. Such organization includes planning as well as setting priorities
                            and goals.</p>

                        <p class="has-line-data">prioritize “To-Do List” every evening before going to bed to prepare
                            for the next day. </p>


                        <h2 class="code-line"><a id="ch_2"></a>
                            Relaxation</h2>

                        <p class="has-line-data">It’s interesting to note that relaxing – by meditating or simply
                            avoiding distractions – is another of the most-often mentioned habits of successful people.
                        </p>
                        <p class="has-line-data">Of course, relaxation comes more easily to those who are organized, so
                            perhaps for some, it is more of a natural byproduct than a conscious decision.
                        </p>
                        <p class="has-line-data">It may also be that the act of “taking a breath” is the successful
                            person’s way of preparing for the effort yet to come. In fact, one of the first steps toward
                            achieving a meditative or relaxed state is to concentrate on your own breathing for three to
                            five minutes.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="code-line"><a id="ch_3"></a>
                            Taking Action</h2>
                        <p class="has-line-data">Third on the list of habits of successful people is the inevitable
                            “action” habit. It is important to organize, to plan, and to set priorities, but without
                            action, a plan is nothing more than potential.
                        </p>
                        <p class="has-line-data">Successful people act – quickly and often. In addition, although it may
                            sound counterintuitive, according to James Clear, they act (start, anyway) before they feel
                            ready. While others come up with reasons not to act, successful people take that
                            all-important first step – even if it seems outlandish.
                        </p>


                        <h2 class="code-line"> <a id="ch_4"></a>
                            Personal Care</h2>
                        <p class="has-line-data">Personal care with regard to diet, exercise, and hygiene comes next on
                            the list of habits of those who are successful.
                        </p>

                        <p class="has-line-data">For some, personal care involves
                            a complex regimen and a highly
                            disciplined lifestyle. For others, not so much. Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla Motors, put it
                            succinctly when asked what daily habit has had the largest positive impact on his life. In a
                            tweet, Musk said simply, “Showering.”
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="code-line"><a id="ch_5"></a> Positive
                            Attitude</h2>
                        <p class="has-line-data">According to many successful people, having a positive attitude is not
                            just a result of being successful – it’s one of the root causes of success.
                        </p>
                        <p class="has-line-data">Joel Brown refers to gratitude and positive self-talk as priorities in
                            the lives of the ultra-successful. Moreover, Brown says, it’s not enough to express
                            gratitude and a positive attitude. You must also remind yourself why you are grateful in
                            order to achieve a deeper effect.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="code-line"> <a id="ch_6"></a>Networking
                        </h2>
                        <p class="has-line-data">Successful people know the value of exchanging ideas with others
                            through networking. They also know the value of collaboration and teamwork – all of which
                            are likely when you network.
                        </p>
                        <p class="has-line-data">Successful people know the
                            importance of surrounding themselves with
                            other successful people, according to author Thomas Corley. Corley says 79% of wealthy
                            people spend at least five hours a month networking.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="code-line"><a id="ch_7"></a> Frugality
                        </h2>
                        <p class="has-line-data">Frugal is not the same as stingy. Frugality is a habit of being
                            thrifty, with money and resources. It is also a habit of being economical. Learning to be
                            economical comes through avoiding waste, which automatically results in efficiency.
                        </p>
                        <p class="has-line-data">Corley notes that wealthy, successful people avoid overspending.
                            Instead, they comparison-shop and negotiate. The result, according to Corley, is financial
                            success through the simple act of saving more money than they spend.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="code-line"><a id="ch_8"></a> Rising
                            Early</h2>
                        <p class="has-line-data">The more time one can devote to being successful, the more likely
                            success will result. Successful people are accustomed to rising early, and that habit
                            appears repeatedly among those who do well in life.
                        </p>
                        <p class="has-line-data">While the “Early Riser’s Club” has a huge membership among successful
                            people, a few notable members include Sir Richard Branson of Virgin Group, Disney CEO Robert
                            Iger and Yahoo’s Marissa Mayer.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="code-line"> <a id="ch_9"></a>Sharing
                        </h2>
                        <p class="has-line-data">Whether through donating to charity or the sharing of ideas, successful
                            people have a habit of giving. They know the value of sharing and most believe their success
                            should result in something more than the accumulation of wealth for themselves.
                        </p>
                        <p class="has-line-data">Some of the most well-known successful philanthropists include Bill and
                            Melinda Gates, Oprah Winfrey and Mark Zuckerberg.
                        </p>
                        <p class="has-line-data">Lack of wealth does not need to be a factor when it comes to sharing.
                            Volunteering in your community or at a local school does not cost anything but could provide
                            help where it is needed most, as KeepInspiring.Me points out.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="code-line"> <a id="ch_10"></a>Reading</h2>
                        <p class="has-line-data">It's important to note that successful people read. While they also
                            read for pleasure, most use their reading habit as a means to gain knowledge or insight.
                        </p>
                        <p class="has-line-data">For anyone who needs inspiration about the value and importance of
                            reading, look no further than the example of billionaire author, J.K. Rowling, who says she
                            read “anything” as a child. She advises, “Read as much as you possibly can. Nothing will
                            help you as much as reading.”
                        </p>
                        <p class="has-line-data">The Bottom Line</p>
                        <p class="has-line-data">Most people have habits – some are positive, some are not. Successful
                            people tend to have more of the kinds of habits that contribute to their success.
                        </p>
                        <p class="has-line-data">The good news, for those who wish to be successful, is that cultivating
                            positive habits takes no more effort than developing bad ones.
                        </p>
                        <p class="has-line-data">Some of the best habits of successful people involve only conscious
                            effort, like getting up early every day. Others, such as becoming organized, may take a
                            little more skill and practice but ultimately result in the most desired outcome of all –
                            success.
